Introduction

\begin_layout Standard
An accurate description of two-phase flows in high-permeability porous media
 is of major importance in several practical applications.
 This includes soil remediation in gravely soils

.
 However, most of the literature on the topic is focused on two-phase flow
 in low-permeability porous media.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For low-permeability porous media, the flow is often dominated by surface
 tension forces and the capillary, Bond and Weber numbers are low.
 In this case, the fluid repartition is well described as two independent
 flow channels 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "blunt2017multiphase,dullien2012porous"
literal "true"

\end_inset

.
 The two fluids are segregated, the non-wetting fluid flowing into the larger
 pores while the wetting fluid occupies the smaller pores, and the area
 of the fluid-fluid interface is small, as illustrated in Fig.
\begin_inset space ~

 (a).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In contrast, for high-permeability porous media, the flow is the result
 of a complex interaction between capillary, gravity, viscous and inertial
 forces 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "davit2018one"
literal "true"

\end_inset

.
 Capillary effects no longer dominate and the Weber, capillary and Bond
 numbers may be large.
 Schematically, the fluids distribution in the pore space take two forms,
 either the non-wetting fluid is continuous and flowing in the center of
 the pore surrounded by the wetting fluid flowing as a thin film in contact
 with the solid, see Fig.
\begin_inset space ~

 (b), or is discontinuous and flowing in the center of the pore as droplets
 or ganglias as in Fig.

 (c).
 Here the surface area between the fluids is large and one would consider
 that the interaction forces between the fluids are not negligible compared
 to their counterpart between the fluid phases and the solid phase, in contrast
 with surface-tension dominated flow for which the area of the fluid-fluid
 interface is small.
 This is important because, as discussed in the following, these terms of
 surface forces between phases are the basis of any attempt to establish
 continuous relationships on a macroscopic scale starting from the pore
 scale and that the interaction between the fluids is commonly overlooked
 in the traditionnal model in porous media.

Illustration of possible fluids distributions in a 2D porous network with
 solid phase in black, the non-wetting fluid (fluid 1) in light grey, and
 the wetting fluid (fluid 2) in white, (a) the two fluids are flowing in
 different channels separated by numerous meniscus, (b) the wetting and
 non-wetting fluids are flowing together in most of the pores as two continuous
 streams and (c) both fluids are flowing together in most of the pores and

 A constitutive relation between the macroscopic pressure of each fluid
 has to be furnished to close the set of the macroscopic equations .
 This relation is known as the capillary pressure relation and, as for the
 relative permeabilities, is supposed to depends non-linearly only on the

 Several experimental works determined the coupled permeability from

 With the same protocol with oil and water in a 2D-sandpack,

 However, it was pointed out that the saturation between the two sets of

 Two remarks must be made at this stage, firstly the presence of obstacles

 by a pillar of circular cross-section, implies that the velocity field
 is three-dimensional near the obstacle because the flow is influenced by
 the no-flow condition over a distance of the order of the aperture

.
 Thus, the parabolic flow profile approximation This also applies to the
 interface between fluids, especially since the integral on the contour
 of the interface in the 
\begin_inset Formula $x-y$
\end_inset

 plane is an approximation, because the curvature of the interface, here
 a half-circle, is neglected.
 As shown in appendix 1, using three-dimensional flow simulations in microchanne
ls, these approximations remain reasonable.

In this section we introduce the standard Level Set method to capture the

Level Set model
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The Level Set method is part of Eulerian methods which have the particularity
 of easily reproducing topological changes of the phases contrary to Lagrangian
 methods.
 As topological changes of the fluids is not excluded here, this motivated
 the choice for this type of method.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In this framework the fluid phases are identified with a level set (scalar)
 function that goes smoothly from 0 to 1 across the fluid interface, which
 is implicitly defined as the iso-level 
\begin_inset Formula $\phi=0.5$
\end_inset

.
 Transport of the level set function 
\begin_inset Formula $\phi$
\end_inset

 is governed by
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\frac{\partial\phi}{\partial t}+\nabla\cdot(\bar{\mathbf{u}}\phi)=\tau\nabla\cdot\left(\psi\boldsymbol{\nabla}\phi-\phi(1-\phi)\frac{\boldsymbol{\nabla}\phi}{\vert\nabla\phi\vert}\right),\label{eq:advecPhi}
\end{equation}

\begin_layout Standard

where 
\begin_inset Formula $\bar{\mathbf{u}}$
\end_inset

 is the in-plane velocity field and 
\begin_inset Formula $\tau$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\psi$
\end_inset

 are two numerical parameters that control the diffuse interface thickness
 and the amount of re-initialization of

 function, respectively
