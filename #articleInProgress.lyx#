\begin_layout Standard
An accurate description of two-phase flows in high-permeability porous media
 is of major importance in several practical applications.
 This includes soil remediation in gravely soils

.
 However, most of the literature on the topic is focused on two-phase flow
 in low-permeability porous media.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For low-permeability porous media, the flow is often dominated by surface
 tension forces and the capillary, Bond and Weber numbers are low.
 In this case, the fluid repartition is well described as two independent
 flow channels 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "blunt2017multiphase,dullien2012porous"
literal "true"

\end_inset

.
 The two fluids are segregated, the non-wetting fluid flowing into the larger
 pores while the wetting fluid occupies the smaller pores, and the area
 of the fluid-fluid interface is small, as illustrated in Fig.
\begin_inset space ~

 (a).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In contrast, for high-permeability porous media, the flow is the result
 of a complex interaction between capillary, gravity, viscous and inertial
 forces 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "davit2018one"
literal "true"

\end_inset

.
 Capillary effects no longer dominate and the Weber, capillary and Bond
 numbers may be large.
 Schematically, the fluids distribution in the pore space take two forms,
 either the non-wetting fluid is continuous and flowing in the center of
 the pore surrounded by the wetting fluid flowing as a thin film in contact
 with the solid, see Fig.
\begin_inset space ~

 (b), or is discontinuous and flowing in the center of the pore as droplets
 or ganglias as in Fig.

 (c).
 Here the surface area between the fluids is large and one would consider
 that the interaction forces between the fluids are not negligible compared
 to their counterpart between the fluid phases and the solid phase, in contrast
 with surface-tension dominated flow for which the area of the fluid-fluid
 interface is small.
 This is important because, as discussed in the following, these terms of
 surface forces between phases are the basis of any attempt to establish
 continuous relationships on a macroscopic scale starting from the pore
 scale and that the interaction between the fluids is commonly overlooked
 in the traditionnal model in porous media.

 A constitutive relation between the macroscopic pressure of each fluid

 This relation is known as the capillary pressure relation and, as for the

 alson used a lattice-Boltzmann method in 2D and 3D pore networks and found
 a non-wetting apparent relative permeability greater than unity when the
 wetting fluid is more viscous than the non-wetting fluid.

 have used a Volume Of Fluid method to study the transport coefficients
 of fluid layers in non-circular capillary tubes.
 Based on analogy with a model Couette flow the authors have derived simple
 relations that can predict with good accuracy the transport coefficients,
 including the coupled ones, of fluid layers.

The literature indicates that fluid interaction terms are mostly not negligible,
 but it is not yet clear what parameters control the value of these terms.
 In 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

 we present a comparison between some of the results available in the literature
 on coupled relative permeability values, adimensionalized with respect
 to the absolute permeability, and the analytical value obtained from steady-sta
te two-phase flow in a capillary tube of circular cross-section.
 This theoretical case represents a limit case regarding the large structure's
 permeability and the large extent of the fluid-fluid interface.
 The discrepancy between the results available in the literature and the
 value for this limit case could be explained by a smaller permeability
 if one based on the qualitative arguments given in this section about the
 relation between the permeability, the flow regime, and the extent of the
 fluid/fluid interface.
 However, the flow regime is impossible to identify in most of the experimental
 work.
 In the end, it is difficult to assess whether the part of the interaction
 terms in the total pressure drop decreases due to a reconfiguration of
 the fluids in the medium or that the friction exerted upon the solid structure
 by the fluids increases due to the lower permeability while the value of
 the interaction terms between fluids would remain stable.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To form a better view of the relative interplay between the permeability,
 the friction exerted upon the solid and the value of the interaction terms
 between the fluids, we perfomed direct numerical simulations in a micromodel.
 Micromodels are widely used for the great control of the flow regimes they
 offer.
 The different two-phase flow regimes has been investigated in such devices
 in several work 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "Avraam1995a,salim2008oil,horgue2013experimental"

 and experiments have been recently conducted in quasi planar micromodels
 to investigate the interfacial interactions between two immiscible fluids
 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "Heshmati2018,Roman2019"
literal "false"

\end_inset

.
 This paper follows this logic and clarifies the influence of the absolute
 permeability of the model porous medium on the interaction between fluids
 using numerical simulations.
 The original idea of the article lies in the use of depth-averaged equations
 averaged over the thickness of the model to vary the permeability without
 changing the geometry.
 It is organized as follows.
 In the next section averaged equations suitable for the study of two-phase
 quasi-planar flows are presented.
 In the next section the numerical method is presented, which is based on
 the monitoring of the interface between fluids by the level-set method.
 Finally, the result section presents a study of the different interaction
 terms between the phases as a function of the capillary number of the flow
 and the absolute permeability of the model porous medium.

 by a wedge of circular cross-section, implies that the velocity field is
 three-dimensional near the obstacle because the flow is influenced by the
 no-flow condition over a distance of the order of the aperture 
\begin_inset Formula $h$
\end_inset

 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

\end_inset

 This also applies to the interface between fluids.
 A second point worth noting is that the integral on the contour of the
 fluid-fluid interface is not strictly equivalent to an integral on this
 surface, here we make an approximation by considering that the contour
 in the 
\begin_inset Formula $x-y$
\end_inset

 plane can be identically translated along the 
\begin_inset Formula $z$

-direction, which is an approximation since the meniscus is a half-circle

Level Set model

\begin_layout Standard
The Level Set method is part of Eulerian methods which have the particularity
 of easily reproducing topological changes of the phases contrary to Lagrangian
 methods.
 As topological changes of the fluids is not excluded here, this motivated
 the choice for this type of method.

In this framework the fluid phases are identified with a level set (scalar)
 function that goes smoothly from 0 to 1 across the fluid interface, which
 is implicitly defined as the iso-level

 Transport of the level set function

\begin_layout Paragraph
Approximation made with respect to the fluid-fluid interface
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We performed three-dimensional one-phase flow simulations into a micro-channel
 to determine the approximation made on the drag calculation when considering
 that the fluid-fluid contour can be translated along the 
\begin_inset Formula $z$
\end_inset

-direction.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
One side of the microchannel is a half-circle wall to mimic a fluid-fluid
 interface while the opposite side is a flat wall (see 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

reference "fig:Microchannel"
plural "false"
caps "true"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

).
 Due to the construction of this geometry by extruding a cylinder to create
 the curved side of the channel, a special treatment has to be done to correctly
 meshed this part and we chosen to build very small chamfers, as depicted
 in 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand formatted
reference "fig:Microchannel"
plural "false"
caps "true"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

.
 We computed the drag force on each side wall of the microchannel and plot
 in 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

plural "false"

\end_inset

 the drag force exerted upon the curved side normalized with respect to
 the flat wall.
 The drag exerted upon the curved wall is between 70% to 80% of the drag
 upon the flat wall and the discrepancy becomes smaller when 
\begin_inset Formula $h/L$
\end_inset

 decreases.
