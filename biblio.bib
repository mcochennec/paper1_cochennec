  comment   = {p 343 : As a general guide, if Ca < 10^6 we consider that the flow is capilarry-controlled and there is no influence of flow rate, while for Ca > 10^3 we reach a viscous-dominated regime. p 255 : (For multiphase Darcy law) we have hypothesized that each phase flows in its own sub-network of the pore space, unaffected by the flow of the other phase. We also ignore any impact of displacement processes: we consider that in some representative elementary volume we have a static configuration of the phases. This fluid arrangement may change slowly, affecting the value of kr. The key assumption inherent in the multiphase Darcy law is that we have a percolation-like displacement pattern, such that there is a representative elementary volume within which we have an avergae saturation that evolves slowly in both space and time. Over the time scale for flow across this elementary volume, the saturation is approximately constat (that there is litlle displacement) , the fluid configuration is fixed and the relative permeabilities are the flow conductance of each phase, which can, in principle, be computed. If instead we have frontal advance, the relative permeability is not defined as a smoothly differentiable function, in that it will vary from a value close to 1 to close to 0 over a pore scale. p 298 : (reasons to designed extensions to the multiphase Darcy law) describe displacement which is not percolation-like and for which the Darcy formulation is intrinsically inappropriate, to include rate-dependent effects, to reduce or eliminate hysteresis in the characterization of capillary pressure and relative permeability; and to incorporate rigorous considerationsof energy, momentum and entropy balance.},

These equations are established separately for each fluid phase, for the solid part of the medium, and for interfaces, by starting from the corresponding equations valid at the pore level and taking their mean value around each point. Then macroscopic entropy balance equations are derived. The entropy source density shows clearly the generalized fluxes and forces which appear in the problem, and suggests how to choose phenomenological equations. A simple example illustrating the method is given in the last paragraph, for a single phase flow with heat transfer in a porous medium. One obtains a generalized form of Darcy's equation. Rigorous conditions along the interfaces and contact lines in a multiphasic medium are given in Appendix.},

  abstract = {An accurate description of the mechanics of pore level displacement of immiscible fluids could significantly improve the predictions from pore network models of capillary pressure–saturation curves, interfacial areas and relative permeability in real porous media. If we assume quasi-static displacement, at constant pressure and surface tension, pore scale interfaces are modeled as constant mean curvature surfaces, which are not easy to calculate. Moreover, the extremely irregular geometry of natural porous media makes it difficult to evaluate surface curvature values and corresponding geometric configurations of two fluids. Finally, accounting for the topological changes of the interface, such as splitting or merging, is nontrivial. We apply the level set method for tracking and propagating interfaces in order to robustly handle topological changes and to obtain geometrically correct interfaces. We describe a simple but robust model for determining critical curvatures for throat drainage and pore imbibition. The model is set up for quasi-static displacements but it nevertheless captures both reversible and irreversible behavior (Haines jump, pore body imbibition). The pore scale grain boundary conditions are extracted from model porous media and from imaged geometries in real rocks. The method gives quantitative agreement with measurements and with other theories and computational approaches.},

  abstract = {The large-scale simulation of CO2 storage operations can be expensive computationally, particularly when the effects of fine-scale capillary pressure heterogeneity are included. The application of upscaling techniques could lead to substantial reductions in computational cost. This work targets the development of an upscaling procedure that is applicable for the CO2 injection stage, which corresponds to a drainage process. Specifically, we develop and apply a new upscaling technique for two-phase flow in heterogeneous formations with capillary heterogeneity effects. The procedure entails first upscaling capillary pressure in the capillary limit, and then computing coarse-scale relative permeability functions using a global dynamic upscaling procedure. An iterative method is applied to enhance the accuracy of the upscaled capillary pressure functions. The new dynamic upscaling approach is applied to a synthetic heterogeneous two-dimensional aquifer model that involves injection of CO2 into brine. Fine-scale simulation results are compared with coarse-scale results generated using both the dynamic upscaling approach and a simpler method that entails the use of upscaled capillary pressure in conjunction with rock relative permeability curves. It is shown that the dynamic upscaling procedure provides results that are close to those from the fine-scale simulation and are consistently more accurate than results from the simpler method. The upscaling procedure is tested over a range of injection rates spanning three orders of magnitude. We show that, although the upscaled functions are in general rate dependent, accurate coarse-scale results can be obtained using upscaled relative permeability functions computed at only two different flow rates. We also observe that the model constructed using our method retains reasonable accuracy even when the flow problem differs from that used to compute the upscaled functions.},

The lubrication approximation theory is used to model the thin-film equation efficiently. The incompressible Navier–Stokes, level-set, and thin-film evolution equations are coupled sequentially to capture the dynamics occurring at multiple length scales. The Hamilton–Jacobi level-set reinitialization is employed to construct the signed-distance function, which takes into account the deposited thin-film on the solid surface. The proposed multiscale method is validated and shown to match the augmented Young–Laplace equation for a static meniscus in a capillary tube. Viscous bending of the advancing interface over the precursor film is captured by the proposed level-set method and agrees with the Cox–Voinov theory. The advancing bubble surrounded by a wetting film inside a capillary tube is considered, and the predicted film thickness compares well with both theory and experiments. We also demonstrate that the multiscale level-set approach can model immiscible two-phase flow with a capillary number as low as 10−6.},

Using the lattice Boltzmann (LB) method, a series of three-dimensional (3D) immiscible displacement simulations are conducted and three typical flow patterns are identified and mapped on the capillary number (Ca)-viscosity ratio(M) phase diagram. We then investigate the effect of the viscosity ratio and capillary number on fluid saturation patterns and displacement stability in Tuscaloosa sandstone, which is taken from the Cranfield site. The dependence of the evolution of saturation, location of the displacement front, 3D displacement patterns and length of the center of mass of the invading fluid on the viscosity ratio and capillary number have been delineated. To gain a quantitative insight into the characteristics of the invasion morphology in 3D porous media, the fractal dimension Df of the non-wetting phase displacement patterns during drainage has been computed for various viscosity ratios and capillary numbers. The logarithmic dependence of Df on invading phase saturation appears to be the same for various capillary numbers and viscosity ratios and follows a universal relation.},

Depending on the nature of these substances and the method by which they were introduced into the environment, they may form a second, dense liquid phase. Several such cases have been reported in the recent literature. In other cases, such a second phase might have actually been present but was not found because the principles governing its distribution were not understood and no effort was made to look for it. In this case, the undetected material could continue to migrate and act as a source of dissolved organics. This article reviews the general principles governing the behavior of dense, immiscible second-phase organic liquids in both the unsaturated and saturated zones, based primarily on the petroleum industry literature for primary hydrocarbon migration and on the oil spill literature. This specialized knowledge can be used to conduct a meaningful and efficient investigation of such contamination sites and can also be used to select and implement successful remedial measures.

The analysis leads to the large-scale form of the momentum equations for the two immiscible fluids, a theoretical representation for the large-scale permeability tensor, and a dynamic, large-scale capillary pressure. The prediction of the permeability tensor and the dynamic capillary pressure requires the solution of a large-scale closure problem. In our initial study (Quintard and Whitaker, 1988), the solution to the closure problem was restricted to the quasi-steady condition and small spatial gradients. In this work, we have relaxed the constraint of small spatial gradients and developed a dynamic solution to the closure problem that takes into account some, but not all, of the transient effects that occur at the closure level.

Because of the highly nonlinear nature of the capillary pressure-saturation relation, small causes can have significant effects, and the treatment of the large-scale capillary pressure is a matter of considerable concern. On the basis of the derived closure problems, estimates ofu$\beta$, etc., are available and they clearly indicate that the nontraditional terms in the momentum equation can be discarded whenlH ≪ℒ. HerelH is the characteristic length scale for the heterogeneities and ℒ is the characteristic length scale for the large-scale averaged quantities. WhenlH is not small relative to ℒ, the nontraditional terms must be considered and nonperiodic boundary conditions must be developed for the closure problem. Detailed numerical studies presented in Part II (Quintard and Whitaker, 1990) and carefully documented experimental studies described in Part III (Berlin et al., 1990) provide further insight into the effects of large spatial and temporal gradients.},

The problem considers upscaling from the Darcy scale of a porous medium to the reservoir scale. We first define the mathematical problem that governs solute mass transport at the so-called Darcy scale, and then we apply the method of volume averaging. This method allows for upscaling the governing equations at the whole reservoir scale and, eventually, developing physical constraints, definitions of average variables and effective coefficients. One important characteristic of the volume averaging method is that the so-called closure problems for analytical or numerical computation of effective coefficients are identified. The closure problems consist of boundary-value problems, whose solution must be carried out in representative geometries (unit cells) of the reservoir. In this paper, we developed the theory for a two-facies reservoir, but the extension for more facies is straightforward. In this context, we present the two-equation model, and the numerical estimation of effective coefficients are presented and discussed for lenticular and layered arrangements of facies. In this manner, relevant coefficients are identified. The numerical solution of the upscaled model agrees well with direct numerical results when the governing equations are solved at the Darcy scale.},

A better understanding of the flow at the pore level appears to be necessary in order to justify and improve closure laws of macroscopic models. To investigate the local features of a two-phase flow in complex geometries, two alternative ways are available: experiments with high accuracy local measurements or direct numerical simulation (DNS) of the flows in small-scale volumes. Within the framework of the second gradient theory, diffuse interface models can be derived for both single-component and binary fluids. The latter model is often referred to as the Cahn–Hilliard model. In this paper, the Cahn–Hilliard model is used to simulate immiscible two-phase flows in a representative geometry of a particle bed. The results are used to characterize the configuration of the phases and possible flow regimes as a function of the saturation. Correlations for the relative permeabilities of each phase as a function of saturation are also presented. The results are discussed and compared with classical correlations.},

Apparently, however, the fact that methodologies are already available for the required laboratory work either is not widely appreciated or it is being overlooked. For this reason and others, mention is made of the surprising fact that the experimental difficulties to be confronted in the actual study of coupled transport processes are no greater than those that have already been dealt with by the advocates of classical relative permeability theory (i.e. the traditionalists who simplistically model two-phase flow as though no coupling effects are involved).},

  abstract = {In this paper, the influence of the interfacial drag on the pressure loss of combined liquid and vapour flow through particulate porous media is investigated. Motivation for this is the coolability of fragmented corium which may be expected during a severe accident in a nuclear power plant. Cooling water is evaporated due to the particles decay heat. To reach coolability, the outflowing steam has to be replaced by inflowing water. The pressure loss for the resulting two-phase flow through the debris is determined by the friction forces at the particles as well as at the interfacial drag between the fluids. In return, the resulting pressure field influences the coolant inflow through the boundaries and thus the coolability of the fragments. Starting from commonly used friction correlations, it is shown that only those with explicit consideration of the interfacial drag can represent the pressure loss. Enhancements for the formulation of the interfacial drag are proposed. This modified model fits experimental data of isothermal air/water experiments as well as data of boiling particle beds.},

  abstract = {A physical model is developed to predict the hydrodynamic parameters of steady-state cocurrent gas–liquid flow through trickle-bed reactors operating in the trickle flow regime. The trickle flow is described by an annular pattern in which the gas and liquid phases are completely separated by a smooth and stable interface. The formulation of the model involves balance equations deduced from the macroscopic mass and momentum conservation laws. The particle–liquid drag and the gas–liquid interactions, i.e. the gas–liquid drag due to the relative motion between the fluids and the force by which the gas pushes the liquid against the solid particles, are evaluated from theoretical considerations. The predictions of the liquid saturation and pressure gradient from the model are found to be in good agreement with existing experimental data obtained in a wide range of operating pressure (0.1–10MPa) for various gas–liquid and packing systems. The present model predicts these two hydrodynamic parameters with a better accuracy than the available correlation ones. Some underestimation of the pressure gradient is observed for the highest values of the superficial gas velocity and operating pressure due to the droplets entrainment and the wavy pattern of the gas–liquid interface that are not taken into account. The fundamental feature of the present model is the total absence of adjustable constants.},

Zemach, A continuum method for modeling surface tension, J. Comput. Phys. 100 (1992) 335–354] introduced the Continuum Surface Force (CSF) method, many methods involved in interface tracking or capturing are based on this reference work. Particularly, the surface tension term is discretized explicitly and therefore, a stability condition is induced on the computational time step. This constraint on the time step allows the containment of the amplification of capillary waves along the interface and puts more emphasis on the terms linked with the density in the Navier–Stokes equation (i.e. unsteady and inertia terms) rather than on the viscous terms. Indeed, the viscosity does not appear, as a parameter, in this stability condition. We propose a new stability condition which takes into account all fluid characteristics (density and viscosity) and for which we present a theoretical estimation. We detail the analysis which is based on a perturbation study – with capillary wave – for which we use energy estimate on the induced perturbed velocity. We validate our analysis and algorithms with numerical simulations of microfluidic flows using a Level Set method, namely the exploration of different mixing dynamics inside microdroplets.},

If capillary forces are neglected, then the saturation equation is a non‐linear hyperbolic conservation law, known as the Buckley--Leverett equation. This equation can be numerically solved by the method of Godunov, in which the saturation is computed from the solution of Riemann problems at cell interfaces. At a discontinuity of permeability this solution has to be constructed from two flux functions. In order to determine a unique solution an entropy inequality is needed. In this article an entropy inequality is derived from a regularisation procedure, where the physical capillary pressure term is added to the Buckley‐Leverett equation. This entropy inequality determines unique solutions of Riemann problems for all initial conditions. It leads to a simple recipe for the computation of interface fluxes for the method of Godunov.},

To verify the predictive potential of the approach to simulate the unstable migration of a dense nonaqueous phase liquid (DNAPL) at the pore scale, the numerical model was applied to laboratory experiments conducted on a sand-filled column. The parameters relative to pore body size and pore throat size used in the construction of the equivalent network were derived from discrete grain-size distribution of the real porous medium. The observed water retention curve (WRC) was first simulated by desaturation of the network model. The good agreement of the modelled WRC with the experimental one highlights that the applied approach reproduces the main characteristics of the real pore space. The numerical model was then applied to rate controlled experiments performed on a homogenous sand-filled column to study the gravity-driven fingering phenomenon of immiscible two-phase flow of water and a DNAPL. The numerical results match within 10% based on the standard deviation with the experiments. They correctly reproduce the effect of several system parameters, such as flow mode (upward flow and downward flow) and the flow rate, on the stability of the water/DNAPL front in a saturated porous medium.},

We use the Discontinuous Galerkin Finite-Element Method (DGFEM) combined with a generalised Godunov scheme to model an immiscible two-phase flow with predominant gravity effects. The saturation profile of a displacing non-aqueous phase liquid (NAPL) in an initially water-saturated porous medium depends strongly on the ratio between the total specific discharge and the density difference between the NAPL and water. We discuss the solution of the nonlinear Buckley-Leverett equation for the general case in which the flux function is non-monotonic. Using a detailed functional analysis of the characteristics of the given hyperbolic equation, three limit cases are identified as significant for modelling the shock and rarefaction regions. The derived maximum (or entry) and front saturations of NAPL are functions of the viscosity ratio M and the gravity number G. We first test the developed numerical model in the case of a one-dimensional highly gravity-driven flow of NAPL within a homogeneous porous medium. The numerically calculated NAPL entry and front saturations of NAPL agree well with the theoretical values. Furthermore, the numerical diffusion of the shock front is lower than that of the calculated using a first-order Finite Volume method, which is generally used in reservoir engineering because of its robustness. Finally, we apply the developed DGFEM scheme to a 2D heterogeneous porous medium and analyse its capability of modelling the non-uniform saturation field using spatial moment analysis.},

  abstract = {The vertical stratification of carbon dioxide (CO2) injected into a deep layered aquifer made up of high-permeability and low-permeability layers, such as Utsira aquifer at Sleipner site in Norway, is investigated with a Buckley–Leverett equation including gravity effects. In a first step, we study both by theory and simulation the application of this equation to the vertical migration of a light phase (CO2), in a denser phase (water), in 1D vertical columns filled with different types of porous media: homogeneous, piecewise homogeneous, layered periodic and finally heterogeneous. For each case, we solve the associated Riemann problems and propose semi-analytical solutions describing the spatial and temporal evolution of the light phase saturation. These solutions agree well with simulation results. We show that the flux continuity condition at interfaces between high-permeability and low-permeability layers leads to CO2 saturation discontinuities at these interfaces and, in particular, to a saturation increase beneath low-permeability layers. In a second step, we analyze the vertical migration of a CO2 plume injected into a 2D layered aquifer. We show that the CO2 vertical stratification under each low-permeability layer is induced, as in 1D columns, by the flux continuity condition at interfaces. As the injection takes place at the bottom of the aquifer the velocity and the flux function decrease with elevation and this phenomenon is proposed to explain the stratification under each mudstone layer as observed at Sleipner site.},

The interface is represented implicitly by the 0.5 level set of a function Φ being a smeared out Heaviside function, i.e., a function being zero on one side of the interface and one on the other. In a transition layer of finite, constant thickness Φ goes smoothly from zero to one. The interface is moved implicitly by the advection of Φ, which is split into two steps. First Φ is advected using a standard numerical method. Then an intermediate step is performed to make sure that the smooth profile of Φ and the thickness of the transition layer is preserved. Both these steps are performed using conservative second order approximations and thus conserving ∫Φ. In this way good conservation of the area bounded by the 0.5 contour of Φ is obtained. Numerical tests shows up to second order accuracy and very good conservation of the area bounded by the interface. The method was also coupled to a Navier–Stokes solver for incompressible two phase flow with surface tension. Results with and without topological changes are presented.},

  abstract = { Liquid invasion into a porous medium is a phenomenon of great importance in both nature and technology. Despite its enormous importance, there is a surprisingly sparse understanding of the processes occurring on the scale of individual pores and of how these processes determine the global invasion pattern. In particular, the exact influence of the wettability remains unclear besides the limiting cases of very small or very large contact angles of the invading fluid. Most quantitative pore-scale experiments and theoretical considerations have been conducted in effectively two-dimensional (2D) micromodels and Hele–Shaw geometries. Although these pioneering works helped to unravel some of the physical aspects of the displacement processes, the relevance of 2D models has not always been appreciated for natural porous media. With the availability of X-ray microtomography, 3D imaging has become a standard for exploring pore-scale processes in porous media. Applying advanced postprocessing routines and synchrotron microtomography, researchers can image even slow flow processes in real time and extract relevant material parameters like the contact angle from the interfaces in the pore space. These advances are expected to boost both theoretical and experimental understanding of pore-scale processes in natural porous media. },

  abstract = {The propagation of capillary waves on material interfaces between two fluids imposes a strict constraint on the numerical time-step applied to solve the equations governing this problem and is directly associated with the stability of interfacial flow simulations. The explicit implementation of surface tension is the generally accepted reason for the restrictions on the temporal resolution caused by capillary waves. In this article, a fully-coupled numerical framework with an implicit treatment of surface tension is proposed and applied, demonstrating that the capillary time-step constraint is in fact a constraint imposed by the temporal sampling of capillary waves, irrespective of the type of implementation. The presented results show that the capillary time-step constraint can be exceeded by several orders of magnitude, with the explicit as well as the implicit treatment of surface tension, if capillary waves are absent. Furthermore, a revised capillary time-step constraint is derived by studying the temporal resolution of capillary waves based on numerical stability and signal processing theory, including the Doppler shift caused by an underlying fluid motion. The revised capillary time-step constraint assures a robust, aliasing-free result, as demonstrated by representative numerical experiments, and is in the static case less restrictive than previously proposed time-step limits associated with capillary waves.},

  abstract = {Computational simulations of two-phase flow in porous media are used to investigate the feasibility of replacing a porous medium containing heterogeneities with an equivalent homogeneous medium. Simulations are performed for the case of infiltration of a dense nonaqueous phase liquid (DNAPL) in a water-saturated, heterogeneous porous medium. For two specific porous media, with periodic and rather simple heterogeneity patterns, the existence of a representative elementary volume (REV) is studied. Upscaled intrinsic permeabilities and upscaled nonlinear constitutive relationships for two-phase flow systems are numerically calculated and the effects of heterogeneities are evaluated. Upscaled capillary pressure–saturation curves for drainage are found to be distinctly different from the lower-scale curves for individual regions of heterogeneity. Irreducible water saturation for the homogenized medium is found to be much larger than the corresponding lower-scale values. Numerical simulations for both heterogeneous and homogeneous representations of the considered porous media are carried out. Although the homogenized model simulates the spreading behavior of DNAPL reasonably well, it still fails to match completely the results form the heterogeneous simulations. This seems to be due, in part, to the nonlinearities inherent to multiphase flow systems. Although we have focussed on a periodic heterogeneous medium in this study, our methodology is applicable to other forms of heterogeneous media. In particular, the procedure for identification of a REV, and associated upscaled constitutive relations, can be used for randomly heterogeneous or layered media as well.},

In this review, I attempt to summarize the most significant recent developments in Eulerian surface tension models, with an emphasis on well-balanced estimation, curvature estimation, stability, and implicit time stepping, as well as test cases and applications. The advantages and limitations of various models are discussed, with a focus on common features rather than differences. Several avenues for further progress are suggested. },

  abstract = {Important features of multiphase flow in porous media that distinguish it from single-phase flow are the presence of interfaces between the fluid phases and of common lines where three phases come in contact. Despite this fact, mathematical descriptions of these flows have been lacking in rigor, consisting primarily of heuristic extensions of Darcy's law that include a hysteretic relation between capillary pressure and saturation and a relative permeability coefficient. As a result, the standard capillary pressure concept appears to have physically unrealistic properties. The present paper employs microscopic mass and momentum balance equations for phases and interfaces to develop an understanding of capillary pressure at the microscale. Next, the standard theories and approaches that define capillary pressure at the macroscale are described and their shortcomings are discussed. Finally, an approach is presented whereby capillary pressure is shown to be an intrinsic property of the system under study. In particular, the presence of interfaces and their distribution within a multiphase system are shown to be essential to describing the state of the system. A thermodynamic approach to the definition of capillary pressure provides a theoretically sound alternative to the definition of capillary pressure as a simple hysteretic function of saturation.},

The multiphase flow hydrodynamics in TBRs are complex and directly affect the overall reactor performance in terms of reactant conversion and product yield and selectivity. Non-ideal flow behaviours, such as flow maldistribution, channelling or partial catalyst wetting may significantly reduce the effectiveness of the reactor. However, conventional TBR modelling approaches cannot properly account for these non-ideal behaviours owing to the complex coupling between fluid dynamics and chemical kinetics. Recent advances in the application of computational fluid dynamics (CFD) to three-phase TBR systems have shown promise of achieving a deeper understanding of the interactions between multiphase fluid dynamics and chemical reactions. This study is intended to give a state-of-the-art overview of the progress achieved in the field of CFD simulation of TBRs over the past two decades. The fundamental modelling framework of multiphase flow in TBRs, advances in important constitutive models, and the application of CFD models are discussed in detail. Directions for future research are suggested.},

The above drag models are then employed in conjunction with force balances on the two phases to obtain the void fraction and pressure gradient as functions of liquid and gas superficial velocities. Results are found to agree very favorably with existing experimental data obtained in both co-current and counter-current flow conditions.

Furthermore, counter-current flooding limits predicted using this hydrodynamic model are found to agree well with existing correlations in the literature.

The relations obtained are used to develop empirical correlations for predicting liquid holdup and pressure drop in gas-liquid cocurrent downflow in packed beds over a wide range of operating conditions. The correlations proposed give very good results when compared to experimental data yielding, in general, mean relative deviations lower than existing correlations. In addition, a new equation is proposed for predicting static holdup in packed beds which is based on a more physically realistic characteristic length than that used in previous studies.},

  abstract = {In order to optimize the design of gas–liquid packed columns used in distillation or in absorption processes, it is of high importance to be able to predict liquid dispersion. Indeed, dispersion phenomena will impact the choice and design of liquid distributing devices and the height of the packed beds. For this, one mainly relies on industrial feedback and on some experimental results obtained at laboratory scale which cannot be directly extrapolated since their geometric characteristics are at least one order of magnitude less than industrial columns in terms of columns diameter and height. To fill this gap CFD simulation tools should be more used since they can apply to any scale. However the latter option requires adequate modeling in particular for dispersion forces which are little studied due to the lack of data for validation. The present paper aims at developing, from original dispersion experimental measurements, closure laws that can be implemented in CFD codes. Liquid spreading from a source point has been investigated for Mellapak 250.X packing via gamma-ray tomography measurements. Closure laws are discussed from a simple 1D model which enables to go further within the Eulerian two-fluid framework with original user-defined functions and associated models that take into account liquid dispersion in the packed bed. The latter is modeled as a porous medium with appropriate closure laws. The comparison between experiments and CFD results shows that the present approach is adequate and should be further developed in order to be more precise and adapted to more packings.},

This eliminates the need to specify small, fictitious saturations of nonwetting fluid ahead of the advancing front where only wetting fluid is present, as is often required in conventional simulators. The model is therefore well suited for the simulation of ground water contamination problems involving the advance of immiscible liquids into previously uncontaminated groundwater systems. The finite difference equations are solved fully implicitly using Newton-Raphson iteration. In order to minimize computer storage and execution time a Dupont-Kendall-Rachford iterative solver utilizing Orthomin acceleration has been incorporated. The numerical model is verified against an exact analytical solution which incorporates fully the effects of both relative permeability and capillary pressure. The model is validated through comparison to a parallel-plate laboratory experiment involving the infiltration of tetrachloroethylene into a heterogeneous sand pack.},

  abstract = {In the present paper we study the immiscible two-phase flow in porous media using the lattice Boltzmann model proposed by He et al. [X. He, R. Zhang, S. Chen, G.D. Doolen, Phys. Fluids 11 (1999) 1143–1152]. By considering a set of appropriate boundary conditions for the density distribution function defined in that model, we account for the effect of wettability at solid–fluid interfaces and capillarity in the pores where the fluid–fluid interfaces reside. Different contact angles of the fluid–fluid interface at solid walls can be realized by taking appropriate values for the density distribution function at the solid sites of the porous domain. It is shown that the steady state contact angle is a linear function of the density value assigned to the solid sites. The model is then applied to the study of viscous coupling effects in immiscible two-phase flow in irregular pore networks, with respect to the overall wetting saturation, the viscosity ratio and the wetting angle. Our results show that when the wetting fluid is less viscous than the non-wetting fluid then the apparent relative permeability of the non-wetting phase may take values greater than unity due to the “lubricating” effect of the wetting films that cover the solid walls. The proposed model is an ideal tool for modeling immiscible two-phase flow in porous media, due both to its ability to incorporate complicated boundary conditions at the pore walls and also capture the physical aspects of the flow in the bulk and the interfaces. Furthermore, the width of the fluid–fluid interfaces is kept less than 3–4 lattice units allowing for simulations in relatively low resolution porous lattices.},

  abstract = {Hypothesis
The effects of mutual transfer of momentum between two immiscible flowing fluids in porous media is not well understood nor predictable yet. From considerations at the pore-scale, it should be possible to determine whether and to what extent interfacial viscous coupling effects are significant.
Experiments
We visualize the velocity distributions inside immobile globules of wetting phase (water) while a non-wetting phase (oil) is injected. We investigate viscous coupling effects and their relationship with the viscosity ratio and the capillary number.
Findings
Four regimes of viscous dissipation are identified: (i) a regime for which the fluid-fluid interface acts as a solid wall; (ii) a regime where the wetting phase is dragged in the direction of the imposed flow; (iii) and (iv) two regimes for which the trapped globule of water shows a recirculating motion due to the shear stress at the oil/water interface. We demonstrate the significant role of the lubricating effect and of the topology of the pore space on the magnitude of viscous dissipation. Importantly, for a viscosity ratio close to one and low capillary number, we demonstrate that viscous coupling effects should be incorporated into the existing Darcy’s law formulation for two-phase flow in porous media.},

The apparatus allows simultaneous study of flow fields at the pore- and micromodel-scales. This system is utilized to develop a deeper insight into the distribution of fluids and shear stress at the interface of invading and defending fluids in two Polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) micromodels: a pore-doublet configuration and a two-dimensional replica of Bentheimer sandstone. We investigate the effect of changes in invading wetting phase flow rate and viscosity and injection of a non-wetting droplet on pore fluid configuration and residual trapping. We discuss how the local perturbations of velocity fields impact displacement of non-wetting phase, the residual trapping, and distributions of the trapped non-wetting phase globules. Furthermore, we map the rotational velocity of the non-wetting fluid within a selected group of trapped globules and discuss how the flow rate of the passing wetting fluid and the momentum transfer across the fluid/fluid interface impacts the stability of the local pore occupancy of the non-wetting phase. The experimental observations provide direct evidence of slip boundary condition at the fluid/fluid interfaces. They show the mechanisms of momentum transfer across the interfaces and their impact on pore-scale displacements and fluid occupancy.},

  abstract = {This paper deals with the comparison of Eulerian methods to take into account the capillary contribution in the vicinity of a fluid–fluid interface. Eulerian methods are well-known to produce additional vorticity close to the interface that leads to non-physical spurious currents. Numerical equilibrium between pressure gradient and capillary force for the static bubble test case within a VOF framework has been reached in [35] with the height-function technique [14], [35]. However, once the bubble is translated in a uniform flow, spurious currents are maintained by slight errors induced by translation schemes. In this work, two main points are investigated: the ability of Volume of Fluid and Level Set methods to accurately calculate the curvature, and the magnitude of spurious currents due to errors in the calculation of the curvature after advection in both translating and rotating flows. The spurious currents source term is expressed from the vorticity equation and used to discuss and compare the methods. Simulations of gas–liquid Taylor flow at low capillary number show that the flow structure and the bubble velocity can be significantly affected by spurious currents.},

For these problems the surface tension is strong and conservation of mass is important. Problems in both two and three dimensions with uniform as well as non-uniform grids are studied. From these calculations convergence and conservation is studied. Good conservation and convergence are observed.},
