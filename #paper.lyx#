\begin_layout Abstract
The macroscopic description of two-phase flows in porous media requires
 accurate modelling of the drag forces between the two fluids and the solid
 phase.
 In standard porous media, where capillarity is often dominant, the fluid-solid
 interactions are well-known and the fluid-fluid drag force is treated in
 a similar way as the drag between fluids and solid in the momentum transport
 equation.
 Two-phase flows in highly permeable porous media, however, are often characteri
zed by a larger area of the interface between the two fluids and the development
 of thin films.
 In such cases, the fluid-fluid drag is not necessarily negligible and may
 play an important role in the momentum transport equations.
 Here, we use computational methods to study two-phase flows in a microfluidic
 device made of an array of cylinders squeezed between two plates in a Hele-Shaw
 flow cell.
 The distinguishing feature of this work is to solve an amalgam Stokes-Darcy
 equations.
 Tangential stresses are handled by the Stokesian part whereas the confinement
 in the out-of-plane direction is controlled by the Darcean term.
 Thus, we explore different ranges of permeability by changing the gap 
\begin_inset Formula $h$
\end_inset

 between the plates whereas the geometry in the cell plane is unmodified.
 The key question adressed in this work is the importance of the fluid-fluid
 drag forces in the overall pressure loss during cocurrent two-phase flows
 and how the flow confinement and the capillary number affect the repartition
 of the drag forces.

.
 However, most of the literature on two-phase flows in porous media is focused
 on low-permeability porous media.
 For low-permeability porous media in the limit of creeping flows, surface
 tension forces often dominate the flow; thus the capillary, Bond, and Weber
 numbers are low.
 In that case, the fluid repartition is well described as two independent
 flow paths for each phase

citep{dullien2012porous,blunt2017multiphase}
\end_layout

\end_inset

.
 The two fluids are segregated, the non-wetting fluid flows into the larger
 pores, whereas the wetting fluid occupies the smaller pores.
 One of the consequences is that the area of the fluid-fluid interface is
 small (Fig.

 (a)) and there is little drag between the fluid phases.
 In contrast, for high-permeability porous media, the flow is the result
 of a complex interaction between capillary, gravity, viscous, and inertial
 forces 
\begin_inset ERT

\begin_layout Plain Layout

citep{davit2018one}
\end_layout

\end_inset

.
 Capillary effects may no longer dominate and the capillary, Bond, and Weber
 numbers may be large.
 The distribution of fluids in the pore space can be schematically decomposed
 in two modes, even though the reality is often a lot more complex.
 Either the non-wetting fluid is continuous and flows in the center of the
 pores surrounded by the wetting fluid flowing as a thin film in contact
 with the solid (Fig.
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset


\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:fluidPatterns"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

 (b)), or the non-wetting fluid is discontinuous and flows in the center
 of the pores in the form of droplets or ganglias (Fig.
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset


\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:fluidPatterns"
plural "false"

\end_inset

 (c)).
 In both cases, the surface area between the fluids is large and the drag
 forces between the fluids are not negligible compared with the solid-fluids
 drag forces.
 This is in strong contrast with capillarity-dominated flow and it is of
 major importance since, as discussed in the following, modelling of the
 drag forces is the basis of any attempt to establish continuous relationships
 on a macroscopic scale starting from the pore scale.

 This generalization depends on the introduction of relative permeabilities
 that essentially account for the division of the available void space between
 the fluids; thus each fluid phase acts as a supplementary solid regarding
 the other one and no interaction between the phases is taken into account

 Since the early 1980s, numerous works have aimed at improving the generalized
 Darcy equations on a sound physical basis.
 Using upscaling techniques, several authors proposed additional coupling
 terms that correspond to stresses at the fluid-fluid interface and yield
 coupling permeability tensors

 Hele-Shaw cells are one of the simplest example of micromodels as they
 consist of two parallel plates which form a thin gap in which the fluids

 fluid-fluid drag and solid-fluids drag for different capillary numbers.
 The distinguishing feature of the article is to solve an amalgam Stokes-Darcy

 effect of the varying absolute permeability on the drag forces without
 having to change the in-plane geometry.

 We obtain these results in the fourth unit-cell (UC4) at steady-state.
 The drag terms are not very sensitive to the mesh density and the interface
 between the fluids is correct even for a coarse mesh and converges quickly.

\begin_layout Section
Results

\begin_layout Standard
We now present the study of the co-current two-phase flows in the aforementionne
d micromodel.
 The results section is organized as follows.
 We start in §
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "par:Flow-regimes-and"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

 with a description of the flow regime observed under the selected flow
 parameters.
 The flow regime is fundamental as it drives the extent of the interfacial
 surface area between the fluids and therefore the amount of fluid-fluid
 drag.
 The saturation and the fluid-fluid interface is also presented as a function
 of the gap thickness and capillary numbers.
 In §
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "par:Pressure-and-velocity"
plural "false"

\end_inset

 we discuss the effect of the flow confinement, i.e.
 the permeability, on the velocity and pressure fields.
 Then we calculate in §

We observe that the two fluids remain continuous at all times and for the

 The interface between the fluids becomes stationary and steady-state is
 reached for every capillary number and values of gap thickness.

 The fluid-fluid interface is periodic on the five central unit cells at

 does not result from an instable displacement, i.e.
 viscous fingering, since both fluids have the same viscosity.
 Here, non-wetting phase break-up could have occured either by snap-off
 phenomenon or beacause of the shear exerted by the wetting fluid.
 However, the pore throat is large and the fractional flow is low, which
 favours the continuity of the non-wetting fluid phase.
 The flow-regime observed is therefore a film-flow regime within the limit
 of the paramaters chosen for this study.

 shows the wetting fluid saturation as a function of the dimensionless gap
 between the plates and for different capillary numbers.
 Wetting fluid saturation at steady-state decreases, in average, from 0.6
 to 0.4 as the aperture between the plates decreases from 5 to 1/20.
 The results for the larger gap are identical to the purely 2d results.
 The saturation fields insets in Fig.

 indicate that the fluid-fluid interfaces are very similar for the thinnest
 gap whereas they largely differ for thinner gaps.
 This last point explains the different saturation we observed.
 Indeed, for low capillary number the interface is flatter than for high
 capillary numbers, as shown in Fig.

.
 Two configurations are possible, either the capillary number is high and
 the fluid-fluid interface is mostly translated toward the pore throat as
 the gap increases, or the capillary number is low enough that the fluid-fluid
 interface is deformed (flattened) and also pushed towards the pore throat
 for an increasing gap thickness.
 These different fluid configurations might involved substantials differences
 in the velocity and pressure fields, for example by forming narrow channel
 with high local velocity, which ultimately may impact the amount of drag.

 shows the pressure field for selected values of capillary number and gap
 thickness.
 The main point here is that the pressure jump across the fluid-fluid interface
 is very difficult to distinguish for the higher capillary number 
\begin_inset Formula $Ca=5\times10^{-1}$
\end_inset

, and especially for the thinnest gap, for which the pressure is uniform
 across the interface.
 That was to be expectes since the main pressure contribution to the pressure
 jump arises from the out-of-plane curvature and thus scales as 
\begin_inset Formula $h^{-1}$
\end_inset

, whereas the pressure gradient across the cell scales as 
\begin_inset Formula $h^{-2}$
\end_inset

 for very thin gap, for which the Darcean terms are expected to be domiannt.
 In contrast, the pressure jump is clearly visible for the lower capillary
 number 
\begin_inset Formula $Ca=2.5\times10^{-2}.$
\end_inset

 In this last case we see that the pressure is higher in the non-wetting
 fluid, which is in agreeement with the out-of-plane meniscus.

\begin_inset CommandInset ref

 shows the velocity field normailzed with respect to the reference velocity
 for the same selected parameters than for the pressure fields.
 We plot also the corresponding streamlines and the position of the fluid-fluid
 interface and we distinguish three cases.
 For the thinnest gap (
\begin_inset Formula $h^{*}=1/20$
\end_inset

), the velocity fields are identical regardless of the capillary number.
 In this case the maximum velocity is reached in the center of the pore
 throat and between the fluid-fluid interface and the wedge boundary.
 In contrast the velocity field depends on the capillary number for the
 thickest gap.
 Either the capillary number is high and the maximul velocity is reached
 precisely in the center of the pore throat or the capillary number is lower
 and the maximum velocity is slightly offset from the centre to directly
 overhang the fluid interface where it forms a narrower constriction.
 In this case we also notice the appearance of recirculation cells in the
 wetting fluid.
 In the following we study the drag force terms and the effect of flow confinmen
t, which is the key ingredient of this study.

s gap and for different capillary numbers.
 The drag forces increase for a narrowing gap between the plates.
 That was to be expected since the inlet velocity and the outlet pressure
 are constant while we explore different values of gap thickness.
 Thus, the Darcean term in the Stokes-Darcy equations indicates that the
 pressure drop across the cell scales as 
\begin_inset Formula $h^{-2}$

, it would have been an error to anticipate that the pressure drop across
 the cell is entirely induced by the drag upon the plates for very thin
 gaps, i.e., very low permeability.
 Indeed, fluid-fluid and fluid-wedge drag also increases approximately as
 
\begin_inset Formula $h^{-2}$
\end_inset

, thus we can already observe that the fluid-fluid drag never becomes negligible.

 Our results show that the fluid-fluid drag is not negligible and is more
 important for larger gap thickness and high capillary number.
 Indeed, it reaches 80% of the solid-solid drag value for 
\begin_inset Formula $Ca=0.5$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $h^{*}=5$
\end_inset

.
 The ratio does not change between the largest gap investigated and the
 2d-results.
 This indicates that the drag between the plates is already negligible for
 the widest gap 
\begin_inset Formula $h^{*}=5$
\end_inset

.
 For a narrowing gap thickness the ratio 
\begin_inset Formula $d_{f}/d_{s}$
\end_inset

 decreases for all capillary numbers.
 For 
\begin_inset Formula $h^{*}<1/2$
\end_inset

, two configurations exist depending on the value of the capillary number.
 Either 
\begin_inset Formula $Ca\geq1.25\times10^{-1}$
\end_inset

 and the ratio barely change with the gap or 
\begin_inset Formula $Ca<1.25\times10^{-1}$

 and the ratio increases, i.e.
 the fluid-fluid drag increases compared to the solid-fluid drag, for a
 narrowing gap.

We now turn to the study of the first regime (

 For very wide gap the drag between the plates is insignificant and the
 only drag remaining are between the fluids and upon the wedge.

 From there, the introduction of the perpendicular confinement drastically
 decreases the fluid-fluid drag value compared to the solid-drag value,

\begin_layout Standard
The thin gap regime (

 drag forces, which is related to the 
\begin_inset Formula $h^{-2}$

 Here we denote the pressure part of the drag force 
\begin_inset Formula $d_{ij}$

\begin_inset Formula $d_{ij,p}=\frac{1}{S}\int_{\Gamma_{ij}}-p_{i}n_{ij}^{x}\:\mathrm{d}\Gamma$

Conclusion
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In this study we conducted direct simulations of depth-averaged two-phases
 flows, and we investigated the effect of the permeability on the drag forces
 exerted upon the different phase interfaces.
 The permeability was changed by varying the Darcean term which arising
 from the depth-averaging, thus without altering the in-plane geometry.
 These drag terms have to be modelled to obtain the macroscopic momentum
 transport equations but the drag exerted upon the the fluid-fluid interface
 is commonly neglected for flow driven by capillarity forces.
 Here we reproduced film-flow regime flow encountered in two-phases flows
 in high permeability porous media or in microfluidic devices.
 Even for a very thin gap between the plates, i.e.
 small permeability, the fluid-fluid tdrag force at the interface is not
 negligible.
 Two regimes are identified, (i) the thick gap regime is characterized by
 the decreasing fluid-fluid drag value compared to the solid-fluid drag.
 This is due to the introduction of the perpendicular confinement which
 scales as 
\begin_inset Formula $h^{-2}$
\end_inset

 whereas the fluid-fluid drag, as well as the fluid-wedge drag, barely increase
 at this stage.
 (ii) The thin gap regime which depend on the capillary number.

\begin_layout Standard
We conduct three-dimensional one-phase flow simulations into a microchannel
 to determine the approximation made on the drag calculation when considering
 that the fluid-fluid contour can be translated along the 
\begin_inset Formula $z$
\end_inset

-direction.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
One side of the microchannel is a half-circle wall to mimic a fluid-fluid
 interface whereas the opposite side is a flat wall (Fig.

 We obtain the curved side by extruding a cylinder; thus a special treatment
 is done to correctly meshed the very thin part left, and we build very
 small chamfers (Fig.

\begin_inset CommandInset ref

 the drag force exerted upon the curved side normalized with respect to
 the flat wall.
 The drag per unit surface area exerted upon the curved wall is roughly
 70% of the drag per unit surface area upon the flat wall.
 Giving the greater extent of surface area for the curved wall, the difference
 regarding the drag value is negligible.
