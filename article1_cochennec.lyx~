\begin_layout Abstract
The macroscopic description of two-phase flow in porous media requires modeling
 the force of interaction between the phases, i.e.
 the two fluids and the solid phase.
 The flow regimes specific to high permeability porous media are characterized
 by a non-negligible extent of the interface between the two fluids, compared
 to the fluid-solid interface

 This argues for the systematic introduction of 
\change_deleted -267026771 1586617926
the 
\change_unchanged
fluid-fluid interaction terms, i.e.
 surface integrals also called traction
\change_inserted -267026771 1586617937
 MQ: useful?
\change_unchanged
, in the macroscopic momentum equations.
 However, we do not know whether these terms are always non-negligible for
 this type of flow regime, for example in cases where the friction with
 the solid becomes very large.
 Here we assess that the share of the traction between the fluids in the
 overall pressure drop increases when the flow is more confined, and thus
 the friction with the solid phase increases.
 The idea of solving modified 2D-Stokes equations with a supplementary Darcy
 term allowed us to modify the absolute permeability of the structure without
 having to modify the geometry per se.
 Our results demonstrate that the absolute permeability of the structure
 does not prejudge the importance of the traction between fluids in the
 total pressure drop as long as the flow regime is characteristic of flow
 in high permeability porous media.

Two-phase flow in high-permeability porous media
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
An accurate description of two-phase flow in high-permeability porous media
 is of major importance for several practical applications.
 One can mention, among others, soil remediation in gravely soils

 or hydrodynamic of catalytic fixed bed reactors

.
 However, most of the literature is dedicated to two-phase flow in low-permeabil
ity porous media.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Due to the larger pore size, two-phase flow in high-permeability porous
 media (hereafter, high-permeability porous media refers to media for which
 the characteristic particle diameter is about one millimeter and above)
 results in a complex interaction between capillary, gravity and viscous
 forces 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "davit2018one"
literal "true"

\end_inset

.
 For low-permeability porous media, the flow is usually dominated by surface
 tension force, i.e.
 the capillary number is low, usually inferior to 
\begin_inset Formula $10^{-3}$
\end_inset

, and the fluid repartition pattern is well described as two independent
 flow streams separate by a multitude of stable meniscus at steady state,
 as illustrated in Fig.

 (a) 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

\end_inset

.
 This regime is characterized by the small extent of the fluid-fluid interface,
 as the fluid phases are segregated, with the wetting phase flowing into
 the larger pores while the wetting phase occupies the smaller pores.
 In contrast, for high permeability porous media, the flow is no longer
 capillary-dominated and the viscous forces become significant (also gravity
 and inertial effects may become important if Bond and Reynolds numbers
 are high, respectively).
 Thus the fluids repartition patterns can take two forms, either the non-wetting
 phase is continuous, see as an example Fig.

 (c).
 For these two options, the wetting phase is flowing as a film in contact
 with the solid and the non-wetting phase flows at the center of the pores
 surrounded by the wetting phase.
 Strictly speaking, these different regimes must be considered when attempting
 to describe two-phase flows with continuous macroscopic equations.
 Indeed, it has been shown several times that the overall flow properties
 depend on the flow regimes 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep

\end_inset

.
 At first glance, one would consider that the exchange terms between the
 fluids, through their common surfaces, as negligible compared to their
 counterpart between the fluid phases and the solid phase for surface-tension
 dominated flow since the extent of the fluid-fluid interface is small.
 On the other hand, and this is what we are interested in here, this is
 not necessarily the case for regimes specific to flow in high-permeability
 porous media for which the extent of the fluid-fluid interface is large.
 This is important because, as discussed in the next section, these exchange
 terms between phases are the basis of any attempt to establish continuous
 relationships on a macroscopic scale starting from the pore scale.

 a sandpack and found that coupled permeabilities reach, at least, 15% of
 the effective permeability value.
 However, it was pointed out that the saturation between the two sets of
 experiments can be very different and therefore the computed relative permeabil

interaction terms between phases.
 The interaction between fluids is neglected in the traditional model used

, while it has been experimentally observed that these terms are important
 when studying two-phase flow in high permeability porous media.
 However, it is not known whether these terms are always important when
 the extent of the interface between the fluids is important.
 For example, do they become negligible when friction with the solid phase
 increases? To what extent? To answer this question, we performed direct
 numerical simulations of two-phase flow in a Hele-Shaw cell

 We solved a coupled Level-Set and Stokes equations with an additional Darcy-ter
m in the momentum equation that pertain for the absolute permeability of
 the flow between two plates.
 Thus, the friction due to the solid walls is increased by decreasing the
 aperture between the cell plates.
 This paper discusses the value of the interaction terms as a function of
 the aperture between the plates, i.e.
 the absolute permeability of the medium, and the capillary number and it
 is organized as follows.

Level Set model
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We used the standard Level Set method to capture the moving free interface
 between the fluids.
 The method is part of Eulerian methods which have the particularity of
 easily reproducing topological changes of the phases contrary to Lagrangian
 methods.
 As topological changes of the fluids is not excluded here, this motivated
 the choice for this type of method.
 In this framework the fluid phases are identified with a level set (scalar)
 function that goes smoothly from 0 to 1 across the fluid interface, which
 is

Flow equations

\begin_layout Standard
Remember that we need to take into account tangential stress as well 
\change_inserted -267026771 1586784333
as 
\change_unchanged
perpendicular stress due to flow confinement, a full-3D resolution of flow
 equations would be meaningful.
 In order to avoid solving such resource-intensive simulations we rather
 resolved 2D flow equations plus an additional term taking into account
 the perpendicular stress.
 Velocity and pressure fields are obtained by solving 2D-modified Stokes
 equations since the Reynolds number is assumed to be sufficiently low so
 that the flow is creeping.
 The whole-domain formulation Stokes and continuity equations read

 value since the sandwiched cylinders contribute to the pressure drop along
 with the cell's plates.
 The absolute permeability of the model is varied by modifying the aperture
 between the two plates.
 We used five different values for the aperture and the correspondence in
 terms of absolute permeability, obtained from single-phase simulations,
 is given in Tab.

 When

 Here, as can be seen in Fig.

\begin_inset CommandInset ref

\end_inset

, the difference in intrinsic mean pressure of the fluids is entirely controlled
 by the pressure jump caused by the out-of-plane meniscus, even for the
 larger aperture, and does not depends on the capillary number at all.
 How the pressure jump compared to the pressure gradient across a cell?
 Based on the pressure fields in Fig.
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset


\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref

\end_inset

 one can answer that for 
\begin_inset Formula $Ca=1$
\end_inset

 the pressure gradient across the cell is larger than the pressure jump
 and, interestingly, it becomes larger and larger than the pressure jump
 as the aperture between the plates is reduced.
 It is quite different when the capillary number decreases, and for 
\begin_inset Formula $Ca=0.01$
\end_inset

 combined with a large aperture the pressure gradient across the cell is
 negligible in front of the pressure jump due to surface tension effects.
 As the aperture decreases, the pressure gradient increases and becomes
 comparable to the pressure jump, but the pressure itsel is differently
 distributed in the cell compared to higher capillary number cases with
 a higher pressure in the wetting fluid.

We now turn to the study of the traction exerted upon the solid-fluid boundaries
 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{T}_{s}$
\end_inset

, i.e.
 fluid 
\begin_inset Formula $i$
\end_inset

 upon the plates and wetting fluid upon the cylinder, along with the traction
 at the fluid-fluid interace 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{T}_{f}$
\end_inset

.
 We focus on the magnitude of the traction exerted at the fluid-fluid interface
 compared to the traction exerted upon the solid boundaries.
 In the following we discuss only the 
\begin_inset Formula $x$

\begin_inset Formula $T^{x}$

, i.e.
 aligned according to the inlet velocity.

The traction exerted upont the plates by the fluids was obtained as described
 in the theoretical backgound section.
 Traction on the cylinder boundary was obtained by calculating the integral

 We computed the fluid-fluid traction 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{T}_{f}$
\end_inset

 in two steps.
 The first step concerns the viscous part of the stress tensor, which was
 calculated directly from the velocity gradients available on the interface
 contour.
 The second step concerns the pressure part, which was obtained by applying
 the divergence theorem on each phase into a cell (UC3).
 
\end_layout

We assessed that the traction exerted on the fluid-fluid boundary reaches
 between 10 and 50% of the traction exerted upon the solid-fluid boundaries,

, on which we plot the ratio 
\begin_inset Formula $T_{f}^{x}/T_{s}^{x}$
\end_inset

 as a function of the dimensionless aperture between the cell plates.
 Interestingly, the ratio varies non-monotonically with 
\begin_inset Formula $h$
\end_inset

 and the maximum value is obtained for the smallest aperture which then
 decreases when the aperture increases.
 The capillary number accentuates the decrease of 
\begin_inset Formula $T_{f}^{x}$

 compared to 
\begin_inset Formula $T_{s}^{x}$

 when it decreases, as can be seen in Fig.

 Between

\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $h^{*}=0.05$
\end_inset

 the traction exerted upon the solid scale as 
\begin_inset Formula $h^{-2}$
\end_inset

, in contrast the traction at the fluid-fluid interface increases faster
 with 
\begin_inset Formula $h$
\end_inset

 over the same interval.
 This explains why 
\begin_inset Formula $T_{f}^{x}/T_{s}^{x}$
\end_inset

 increases as the aperture between the plates decreases.
 To go further we studied separately the pressure part and the viscous contribut
ion in Eq.

 For 
\begin_inset Formula $h^{*}<0.5$
\end_inset

 the pressure part largely dominates the viscous contribution and the evolution
 of the traction is therefore controlled by it.
 The pressure part scales as 
\begin_inset Formula $h^{-2}$
\end_inset

for 
\begin_inset Formula $Ca=1$
\end_inset

 but increases faster when the capillary number decreases.

The code is validated by comparison with a Boundary-Element Method, which
 relies on a surface discretization of the interface and a pseudo-analytical
 formulation in the bulk of the phases.
 This allows us to precisely locate the interface, even in the case of very
