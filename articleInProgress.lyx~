\begin_layout Abstract
The macroscopic description of two-phase flows in porous media requires
 accurate modelling of the drag forces between the two fluids and the solid
 phase.
 In standard porous media, where capillarity is often dominant, the fluids-solid
 interactions are well-known and the fluid-fluid drag force is neglected
 in the momentum transport equations.
 High permeability porous media, however, are often characterized by a larger
 area of the interface between the two fluids and the development of thin
 films.
 In such cases, the fluid-fluid interaction is not necessarily negligible,
 and may play an important role in the momentum transport equations.
 Here, we use computational methods to study two-phase flows in a microfluidic
 device made of an array of cylinders.
 The idea is to keep the geometry of the device in the 
\begin_inset Formula $x-y$
\end_inset

 plane identical, while changing the aperture between the plates to explore
 different ranges of permeability.
 We assess that the share of the drag between the fluids in the overall
 pressure drop increases when the aperture decreases, and thus the absolute
 permeability increases.

\begin_layout Standard
An accurate description of two-phase flows in high-permeability porous media
 is of major importance in several practical applications.
 This includes soil remediation in gravely soils

.
 However, most of the literature on the topic is focused two-phase flow
 in low-permeability porous media.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For low-permeability porous media, the flow is often dominated by surface
 tension forces and the capillary, Bond and Weber numbers are low.
 In this case, the fluid repartition is well described as two independent
 flow channels 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "dullien2012porous,blunt2017multiphase"
literal "true"

\end_inset

.
 The two fluids are segregated, the non-wetting fluid flowing into the larger
 pores while the wetting fluid occupies the smaller pores, and the area
 of the fluid-fluid interface is small, as illustrated in Fig.
\begin_inset space ~

 (a).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In contrast, for high-permeability porous media, the flow is the result
 of a complex interaction between capillary, gravity, viscous and inertial
 forces 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "davit2018one"
literal "true"

\end_inset

.
 Capillary effects no longer dominate and the Weber, capillary and Bond
 numbers may be large.
 Schematically, the fluids distribution in the pore space take two forms,
 either the non-wetting fluid is continuous and flowing in the center of
 the pore surrounded by the wetting fluid flowing as a thin film in contact
 with the solid, see Fig.

 (b), or is discontinuous and flowing in the center of the pore as droplets
 or ganglias as in Fig.

 (c).
 Here the surface area between the fluids is large and one would consider
 that the surface forces between the fluids are not negligible compared
 to their counterpart between the fluid phases and the solid phase, in contrast
 with surface-tension dominated flow for which the area of the fluid-fluid
 interface is small.
 This is important because, as discussed in the following, these terms of
 surface forces between phases are the basis of any attempt to establish
 continuous relationships on a macroscopic scale starting from the pore
 scale and that the interaction between the fluids is commonly overlooked
 in the traditionnal model in porous media.

Illustration of possible fluids distributions in a 2D porous network with
 solid phase in black, the non-wetting fluid (fluid 1) in light grey, and
 the wetting fluid (fluid 2) in white, (a) the two fluids are flowing in
 different channels separated by numerous meniscus, (b) the wetting and
 non-wetting fluids are flowing together in most of the pores as two continuous
 streams and (c) both fluids are flowing together in most of the pores and
 the non-wetting phase is discontinuous.

 in soils is based on a direct extension of the Darcy's equation and does
 not take into account the interaction between the fluids.

, thus the relative permeability depends (non-linearly) only on the saturation.
 To close the set of the macroscopic equations a constitutive relation between
 the macroscopic pressure of each fluid has to be furnished.
 This relation is known as the capillary pressure relation and, as for the
 relative permeabilities, is supposed to depends non-linearly only on the
 saturation

 are the coupled relative permeability tensors that pertain to the interaction
 between the fluids.
 Several experimental works determined the coupled permeability for a steady-sta
te cocurent flow of oil and water in a cylindrical sandpack sandpack.
 Each fluid was submitted alternatively to a null pressure gradient to isolate
 each terms.
 This protocol was used in 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

 and the authors found a negligible effect of the coupled permeabilities
 in the overall flow.
 With the same protocol with oil and water in a 2D-sandpack, authors 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

 found that the coupled permeabilities are important since they can contribute
 up to 35% of the effective permeability.

 with water and oil in a sandpack found that coupled permeabilities reach,
 at least, 15% of the effective permeability value.
 However, it was pointed out that the saturation between the two sets of
 experiments can be very different and therefore the computed relative permeabil
ities can not be safely compared

 The effect of the non-wetting phase connectivity on the transport parameters
 was extensively studied in

, in which the authors performed steady-state cocurrent two-phase flow in
 2D-micromodel experiments and found that the contribution of the coupled
 permeabilities on the flow is non-negligible and depend on the flow regimes.

In terms of numerical studies, the early work of Rothman 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

 examined the question by conducting two-phase flow simulations in simple
 geometries with an immiscible lattice-gas method.
 The author found a non-negligible participation of the coupled permeabilities
 by applying the volume force alternatively on each fluid.
 In 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep

\end_inset

, the authors used the lattice-Boltzmann method and examined the value of
 the coupled permeabilities as a function of the saturation in a 3D-sphere
 pack and they found results in agreement with Rothman's results.
 Other authors used a lattice-Boltzmann method in 2D and 3D pore networks

 and found a non-wetting apparent relative permeability greater than unity
 when the wetting fluid is more viscous than the non-wetting fluid.
 Recently 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

key "shams2018study"

, authors have used a Volume Of Fluid method to study the transport coefficients
 of fluid layers in non-circular capillary tubes.
 Based on analogy with a model Couette flow the authors have derived simple
 relations that can predict with good accuracy the transport coefficients,
 including the coupled ones, of fluid layers.
