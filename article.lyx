\begin_layout Abstract
The macroscopic description of two-phase flows in porous media requires
 accurate modelling of the drag forces between the two fluids and the solid
 phase.
 In standard porous media, where capillarity is often dominant, the fluids-solid
 interactions are well-known and the fluid-fluid drag force is neglected
 in the momentum transport equation.
 Two-phases flows in high permeability porous media, however, are often
 characterized by a larger area of the interface between the two fluids
 and the development of thin films.
 In such cases, the fluid-fluid interaction is not necessarily negligible
 and may play an important role in the momentum transport equations.
 Here, we use computational methods to study two-phase flows in a microfluidic
 device made of an array of cylinders sandwiched in a Hele-Shaw cell.
 The idea is to keep the geometry in the cell plane unaltered, while changing
 the height in the orthogonal direction, i.e.
 the cell plates aperture 
\begin_inset Formula $h$
\end_inset

, to explore different ranges of permeability.
 This was done by taking advantage of the quasi-planar nature of the flow
 which justifies the use of depth-averaged flow equations.
 Here we reproduce a film-flow regime and show that the drag exerted at
 the fluid-fluid interface is between 5% and 60% of the drag exerted upon
 the solid.
 Furthermore, we found that the drag exerted upon the fluid-fluid interface
 increases as 
\begin_inset Formula $h^{-3}$
\end_inset

 while the solid-fluid drag increases as 
\begin_inset Formula $h^{-2}$
\end_inset

.
 Our results demonstrate that the fluid-fluid drag force should not be neglected
 in momentum tranport equations when modelling macroscopic two-phase flows
 in microfluidic devices or highly permeable porous media, for which the
 film-flow regime is commonly encountered.

An accurate description of two-phase flows in high-permeability porous media
 is of major importance in several practical applications.
 This includes soil remediation in gravely soils

.
 However, most of the literature on the topic is focused on two-phase flow
 in low-permeability porous media.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For low-permeability porous media, the flow is often dominated by surface
 tension forces, and the capillary, Bond, and Weber numbers are low.
 In this case, the fluid repartition is well described as two independent
 flow channels 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "blunt2017multiphase,dullien2012porous"
literal "true"

\end_inset

.
 The two fluids are segregated, the non-wetting fluid flowing into the larger
 pores while the wetting fluid occupies the smaller pores, and the area
 of the fluid-fluid interface is small, as illustrated in Fig.
\begin_inset space ~

 (a).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In contrast, for high-permeability porous media, the flow is the result
 of a complex interaction between capillary, gravity, viscous, and inertial
 forces 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "davit2018one"
literal "true"

\end_inset

.
 Capillary effects no longer dominate and the Weber, capillary, and Bond
 numbers may be large.
 Schematically, the fluids distribution in the pore space take two forms,
 either the non-wetting fluid is continuous and flowing in the center of
 the pore surrounded by the wetting fluid flowing as a thin film in contact
 with the solid, see Fig.
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset


\begin_inset CommandInset ref

 (b), or is discontinuous and flowing in the center of the pore as droplets
 or ganglias as in Fig.

\begin_inset CommandInset ref

\end_inset

 (c).
 Here the surface area between the fluids is large and one would consider
 that the interaction forces between the fluids are not negligible compared
 to their counterpart between the fluid phases and the solid phase, in contrast
 with surface-tension dominated flow for which the area of the fluid-fluid
 interface is small.
 This is important because, as discussed in the following, these terms of
 surface forces between phases are the basis of any attempt to establish
 continuous relationships on a macroscopic scale starting from the pore
 scale and that the interaction between the fluids is commonly overlooked
 in the traditional model in porous media.

\begin_inset CommandInset citation

 also used a lattice-Boltzmann method in 2D and 3D pore networks and found
 a non-wetting apparent relative permeability greater than unity when the
 wetting fluid is more viscous than the non-wetting fluid.
 Recently 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

 have used a Volume Of Fluid method to study the transport coefficients
 of fluid layers in non-circular capillary tubes.
 Based on analogy with a model Couette flow the authors have derived simple
 relations that can predict with good accuracy the transport coefficients,
 including the coupled ones, of fluid layers.

The literature indicates that fluid interaction terms are mostly not negligible,
 but it is not yet clear what parameters control the value of these terms.
 In 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

 This theoretical case represents a limit case regarding the large structure's
 permeability and the large extent of the fluid-fluid interface.
 The discrepancy between the results available in the literature and the
 value for this limit case could be explained by a smaller permeability
 if one based on the qualitative arguments given in this section about the
 relation between the permeability, the flow regime, and the extent of the
 fluid/fluid interface.
 What is important here is that the effect of the permeability is broader
 than the flow regime changes.
 Indeed the part of the interaction terms in the total pressure drop could
 decreases due to a reconfiguration of the fluids in the medium or because
 of the increasing friction exerted upon the solid structure by the fluids
 due to the lower permeability, while the value of the interaction terms
 between fluids would remain stable.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To form a better view of the relative interplay between the permeability,
 the friction exerted upon the solid, and the value of the interaction terms
 between the fluids, we performed direct numerical simulations in a micromodel.
 Micromodels are widely used for the great control of the flow regimes they
 offer.
 The different two-phase flow regimes have been investigated in such devices
 in several work 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "Avraam1995a,salim2008oil,horgue2013experimental"

 and experiments have been recently conducted in quasi planar micromodels
 to investigate the interfacial interactions between two immiscible fluids
 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

literal "false"

\end_inset

.
 This paper follows this logic and clarifies the influence of the absolute
 permeability of the model porous medium on the interaction between fluids
 using numerical simulations.
 The original idea of the article lies in the use of depth-averaged equations
 to vary the permeability without having to change the geometry.
 It is organized as follows.
 In the next section averaged equations suitable for the study of two-phases
 quasi-planar flows are presented.
 In the section after the numerical method is presented, which is based
 on the level-set method for the tracking of the interface between fluids.
 Finally, the result section presents a study of the different interaction
 terms between the phases as a function of the capillary number of the flow
 and the absolute permeability of the model porous medium.

\end_inset

 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

\end_inset

 This also applies to the interface between fluids.
 A second point is that the integral on the fluid-fluid boundary interface
 is not strictly equivalent to an integral on this surface, here we make
 an approximation by considering that the contour in the 
\begin_inset Formula $x-y$
\end_inset

 plane can be identically translated along the

Here we study the convergence of the various drag quantities we are interested
 in as a function of the number of mesh elements in the whole geometry.
 The dimensionless numbers for this study were

\begin_inset Formula $f_{f}=0.25$
\end_inset

 and

 We used a quadratic discretization for the velocity and the level-set function,
 and a linear discretization for the pressure.

Before we turn to the study of drag force terms, we briefly discuss the

\begin_layout Paragraph
Flow regime 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We observed that the two fluid phases remain continuous at all times and
 for the entire range of capillary and aspect ratio tested.
 At a point, the interface between the fluids becomes stationary and a stationar
y state is reached for every capillary and aspect ratio value.
 Initial, intermediate, and final configurations of the fluid repartition
 are presented in 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand formatted
reference "fig:Fluid-repartion-along"
plural "false"
caps "true"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

.
 At steady-state, the fluid-fluid interface is periodic on the three central
 unit cells however the interface is slightly distort at the inlet and outlet
 cells, under the influence of boundary conditions.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The flow-regime observed is a film-flow regime in each case.
 This flow-regime is ideal to study the magnitude of fluids interaction
 terms, because the extent of the fluid-fluid interface is comparable to
 the extent of the fluid-solid interface and because the interface is parallel
 to the dominant direction of the flow and is therefore subject to high
 drag.
 In the following work, the results were obtained in the central unit cell
 UC3, and after steady-state was reached.

Saturation
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Wetting fluid saturation at steady-state decreases from 0.6 to 0.3 when the
 aperture between the plates decreases, as one can see in

reference "fig:wettingFluidSaturation"
plural "false"
caps "true"

\end_inset

, on which the saturation in UC3 is given as a function of the dimensionless
 aperture and different capillary numbers.
 As the aperture between the plates increases, the interface becomes flatter,
 while the film thickness at the throat pore level barely changes, so the
 saturation of the wetting fluid increases.
 This is noticeable on the embedded saturation fields in 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand formatted
reference "fig:wettingFluidSaturation"

noprefix "false"

\end_inset

.
 For an increasing capillary number the wetting fluid saturation slightly
 decreases, while with a more limited effect that aperture variation.

Drag force

Drag force exerted upon the fluid-fluid interface was computed according
 to 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand formatted
reference "eq:averagedFull"
plural "false"
caps "true"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

.
 The viscous part is obtained through the velocity gradient available at
 the 
\begin_inset Formula $\phi=0.5$
\end_inset

 contour while the pressure part was obtained by application of the divergence
 theorem (see appendix 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand formatted
reference "sec:pressureDrag"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

).
 The drag force exerted upon the wedge boundary, viscous and pressure part,
 was computed straight forward.
 In the following we are interested in the drag force compenent in the 
\begin_inset Formula $x$
\end_inset

-direction, i.e.
 the main flow direction.
 The total drag force (
\begin_inset Formula $x$
\end_inset

-component) exerted upon the solid-fluid boundaries, denoted 
\begin_inset Formula $d_{s}^{x}$
\end_inset

, is the sum of the drag upon the wedge and upon the cell plates by both
 fluids.
 The total drag exerted upon the fluid-fluid interface, denoted 
\begin_inset Formula $d_{f}^{x}$
\end_inset

, is the sum of the contibution of each fluids, i.e.
 
\begin_inset Formula $d_{f}^{x}=d_{ow}^{x}+d_{wo}^{x}$
\end_inset

.
 In the following, the 
\begin_inset Formula $x$
\end_inset

–component of the drag forces are expressed by unite surface area of unit-cell.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The total drag exerted upon the fluid-fluid interface reaches between 5
 and 60% of the total drag exerted upon the solid-fluid boundaries, as can
 be seen in 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand formatted
reference "fig:ratioDragForceTotal"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

, on which we plot the ratio 
\begin_inset Formula $d_{f}^{x}/d_{s}^{x}$
\end_inset

 as a function of the dimensionless aperture between the cell plates and
 for different capillary numbers.
 The main observation here is that the drag upon the fluid-fluid interface
 is not negligible here compared compared to the drag upon the solid-fluid
 interface.
 This could be anticipated by the flow regime, as discussed above, which
 is very favourable to the interactions between the two fluids.
 Interestingly, thepart of the drag upont the fluid-fluid interface increases,
 compared to the drag upon the solid-fluid interface, as the aperture between
 the plates decreases.
 At first glance, this may seem contradictory, since narrowing the aperture
 increases the pressure drop due to drag on the plates.

 we present the total drag upon either the solid-fluid interface or the
 fluid-fluid interface as a function of the dimensionless aperture.
 The drag forces at the fluid-fluid and solid-fluid interfaces logically
 increase as the capillary number increases.
 As the aperture between the plates decreases, the drag upon the fluid-solid
 interfaces also increases, which was to be expected.
 Regarding 
\begin_inset Formula $Ca=1$
\end_inset

, both 
\begin_inset Formula $d_{s}^{x}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $d_{f}^{x}$
\end_inset

 evolve as 
\begin_inset Formula $h^{-2}$
\end_inset

.
 However, for smaller capillary numbers, the drag upon the fluid-fluid interface
 scales much as 
\begin_inset Formula $h^{-3}$
\end_inset

 while the drag upon the solid-fluid interface remains the same with a 
\begin_inset Formula $h^{-2}$
\end_inset

 behaviour.
 This explains the influence of the capillary number and the origin of the
 variation in the ratio between the drag forces at the different interfaces.
 We mention that 
\begin_inset Formula $d_{s}^{x}$
\end_inset

 is not entirely driven by the fluid friction upon the plates, as might
 be suggested by the 
\begin_inset Formula $h^{-2}$
\end_inset

 behavior, in fact, the drag force upon the wedge is at least about 80%
 of the drag upon the plates, for 
\begin_inset Formula $h^{*}=1/20$
\end_inset

\end_inset

 we present the viscous and the pressure part of the drag force exerted
 upon the fluid-fluid interface.
 For dimensionless aperture lower than 
\begin_inset Formula $1/2$
\end_inset

, the viscous part is negligible in front of the pressure part.
 Thus, the pressure drives the 
\begin_inset Formula $h^{-2}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $h^{-3}$
\end_inset

 behaviors, depending on the capillary number.
 As the plates aperture decreases, for a constant inlet velocity and a constant
 output pressure boundary condition; the pressure gradient through the micromode
l increases, and the pressure force exerted by the flow on the solid-fluid
 and fluid-fluid interfaces as well.
 To better understand the effect of capillary number on pressure one can
 look at the pressure fields in UC3 for different capillary numbers and
 different apertures, as shown in 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand formatted
reference "fig:Pressure-field"
plural "false"
caps "true"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

.
 Regarding 
\begin_inset Formula $Ca=1$
\end_inset

, the pressure gradient along the 
\begin_inset Formula $x$
\end_inset

-direction across the cell is multiplied by 100 while the opening between
 the plates divided by ten, following 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand formatted
reference "eq:darcyHeleShaw"
plural "false"
caps "true"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

 .
 Now, for 
\begin_inset Formula $Ca=0.01$
\end_inset

, and for the same change of plates aperture, the pressure gradient across
 the cell is multiplied by 2,000.
 A noteworthy feature ot the pressure gradient is how it compares with the
 pressure jump across the fluid-fluid interface because of its curavture.
 Indeed, for 
\begin_inset Formula $Ca=1$
\end_inset

, the pressure jump and the pressure gradient are about the same order when
 
\begin_inset Formula $h^{*}=0.5$
\end_inset

, but the former becomes negligible in front of the latter as the opening
 decreases.
 This is to be expected since the pressure gradient increases as 
\begin_inset Formula $h^{-2}$
\end_inset

, whereas the pressure jump increases as 
\begin_inset Formula $h^{-1}$
\end_inset

 since it is mainly induced by the curvature in the 
\begin_inset Formula $z$
\end_inset

-direction.

Conclusion
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In this study we conducted direct simulations of depth-averaged two-phases
 flow, and we investigated the effect of the permeability on the drag forces
 exerted upon the different interfaces.
 The permeability was changed by varying the Darcean term which arising
 from the depth-averaging, thus without altering the in-plane geometry.
 These drag terms have to be modelled to obtain the macroscopic momentum
 transport equations but the drag exerted upon the the fluid-fluid interface
 is commonly neglected for flow driven by capillarity forces.
 Here we focused on film-flow regime encountered in two-phases flows in
 high permeability porous media or in microfluidic devices.
 We found that the drag exerted upon the fluid-fluid interface should not
 be neglected into the momentum transport equations for film-flow regimes.
 Lower permeability does not make the drag force terms at the interface
 negligible as long as the flow regime remains a film regime.
 On the contrary, the drag force upon the fluid-fluid interface increases
 faster than the drag upon the fluid-solid interfaces, as the aperture between
 the plates decreases.

\begin_layout Paragraph
Approximation made with respect to the fluid-fluid interface
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We performed three-dimensional one-phase flow simulations into a micro-channel
 to determine the approximation made on the drag calculation when considering
 that the fluid-fluid contour can be translated along the 
\begin_inset Formula $z$
\end_inset

-direction.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
One side of the microchannel is a half-circle wall to mimic a fluid-fluid
 interface while the opposite side is a flat wall (see 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand formatted
reference "fig:Microchannel"
plural "false"
caps "true"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

).
 Due to the construction of this geometry by extruding a cylinder to create
 the curved side of the channel, a special treatment has to be done to correctly
 meshed this part and we chose to build very small chamfers, as depicted
 in 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand formatted
reference "fig:Microchannel"
plural "false"
caps "true"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

.
 We computed the drag force per unit surface area on each sidewall of the
 microchannel and plot in 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand formatted
reference "fig:Drag-force-exerted"
plural "false"
caps "true"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

 the drag force exerted upon the curved side normalized with respect to
 the flat wall.
 The drag per unit surface area exerted upon the curved wall is roughly
 70% of the drag per unit surface area upon the flat wall.
 Giving the greater extent of surface area for the curved wall, the difference
 regarding the drag computation is negligible.
