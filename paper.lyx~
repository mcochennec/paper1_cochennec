\begin_layout Abstract
The macroscopic description of two-phase flows in porous media requires
 accurate modelling of the drag forces between the two fluids and the solid
 phase.
 In standard porous media, where capillarity is often dominant, the fluid-solid
 interactions are well-known and the fluid-fluid drag force is treated in
 a similar way as the drag between fluids and solid in the momentum transport
 equation.
 Two-phase flows in highly permeable porous media, however, are often characteri
zed by a larger area of the interface between the two fluids and the development
 of thin films.
 In such cases, the fluid-fluid drag is not necessarily negligible and may
 play an important role in the momentum transport equations.
 Here, we use computational methods to study two-phase flows in a microfluidic
 device made of an array of cylinders squeezed between two plates in a Hele-Shaw
 flow cell.
 The distinguishing feature of this work is to solve an amalgam Stokes-Darcy
 equations.
 Tangential stresses are handled by the Stokesian part whereas the confinement
 in the out-of-plane direction is controlled by the Darcean term.
 Thus, we explore different ranges of permeability by changing the gap 
\begin_inset Formula $h$
\end_inset

 between the plates whereas the geometry in the cell plane is unmodified.
 The key question adressed in this article is the importance of the fluid-fluid
 drag forces in the overall pressure loss during two-phase flows for which
 both fluis are coinjected and how the flow confinement and the capillary
 number affect the repartition of the drag forces.

.
 However, most of the literature on two-phase flows in porous media is focused
 on low-permeability porous media.
 For low-permeability porous media in the limit of creeping flows, surface
 tension forces often dominate the flow; thus the capillary, Bond, and Weber
 numbers are low.
 In that case, the fluid repartition is well described as two independent
 flow paths for each phase

citep{dullien2012porous,blunt2017multiphase}
\end_layout

\end_inset

.
 The two fluids are segregated, the non-wetting fluid flows into the larger
 pores, whereas the wetting fluid occupies the smaller pores.
 One of the consequences is that the area of the fluid-fluid interface is
 small (Fig.

 (a)) and there is little drag between the fluid phases.
 In contrast, for high-permeability porous media, the flow is the result
 of a complex interaction between capillary, gravity, viscous, and inertial
 forces

\begin_layout Plain Layout

citep{davit2018one}
\end_layout

\end_inset

.
 Capillary effects may no longer dominate and the capillary, Bond, and Weber
 numbers may be large.
 The distribution of fluids in the pore space can be schematically decomposed
 in two modes, even though the reality is often a lot more complex.
 Either the non-wetting fluid is continuous and flows in the center of the
 pores surrounded by the wetting fluid flowing as a thin film in contact
 with the solid (Fig.
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset


\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:fluidPatterns"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

 (b)), or the non-wetting fluid is discontinuous and flows in the center
 of the pores in the form of droplets or ganglias (Fig.

\end_inset


\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:fluidPatterns"

\end_inset

 (c)).
 In both cases, the surface area between the fluids is large and the drag
 forces between the fluids are not negligible compared with the solid-fluids
 drag forces.
 This is in strong contrast with capillarity-dominated flow and it is of
 major importance since, as discussed in the following, modelling of the
 drag forces is the basis of any attempt to establish continuous relationships
 on a macroscopic scale starting from the pore scale.

 This generalization depends on the introduction of relative permeabilities
 that essentially account for the division of the available void space between
 the fluids; thus each fluid phase acts as a supplementary solid regarding
 the other one and no interaction between the phases is taken into account

 Since the early 1980s, numerous works have aimed at improving the generalized
 Darcy equations on a sound physical basis.
 Using upscaling techniques, several authors proposed additional coupling
 terms that correspond to stresses at the fluid-fluid interface and yield
 coupling permeability tensors

 Hele-Shaw cells are one of the simplest example of micromodels as they
 consist of two parallel plates which form a thin gap in which the fluids

 fluid-fluid drag and solid-fluids drag for different capillary numbers.

 The drag terms are not very sensitive to the mesh density and the interface
 between the fluids is correct even for a coarse mesh and converges quickly.

Results and discussion
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Before we discuss the results for the drag force terms, we present the two-phase
 flow regime observed along with the variation of the saturation with time.
 The flow regime is fundamental as it drives the extent of the interfacial
 surface area between the fluids.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Flow regimes and fluids saturation
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We observe that the two fluids remain continuous at all times and for the
 entire range of tested capillary numbers and gap thickness.
 The interface between the fluids becomes stationary and a stationary state
 is reached for every capillary number and values of gap between the plates.

 repartition for

\begin_inset Formula $h^{*}=1/8.$

 At steady-state, the fluid-fluid interface is periodic on the five central
 unit cells whereas the interface is slightly deformed at the inlet and
 outlet cells, under the influence of boundary conditions.

 does not result from an instable displacement, i.e.
 viscous fingering, since both fluids have the same viscosity.
 Here, non-wetting phase break-up could have occured either by snap-off
 phenomenon or beacause of the shear exerted by the wetting fluid.
 However, the pore throat is large and the fractional flow is low, which
 favours the continuity of the non-wetting fluid phase.
 The flow-regime observed is therefore a film-flow regime within the limit
 of the paramaters chosen for this study.

 between the plates and for different capillary numbers.
 Wetting fluid saturation at steady-state decreases, in average, from 0.6
 to 0.4 as the aperture between the plates decreases from 5 to 1/20.
 The results for the larger gap are identical to the pure 2d results.

 thickness is large whereas they largely differ for the largest gap tickness.
 This last point explains the different saturation we observed.
 Indeed, for low capillary number the interface is flatter than for high
 capillary numbers, as shown in Fig.

 The drag forces increase for a narrowing gap between the plates.
 This was expected since the inlet velocity and the outlet pressure are
 constant while we explore different values of gap thickness.
 Thus, the pressure drop across the cell increases as the gap thickness
 decreases.

 shows the ratio of the fluid-fluid drag over the solid-fluid drag.
 We sum the contribution of both fluids here and our results show that the
 fluid-fluid drag is not negligible and is more important for larger gap
 thickness and high capillary number.
 Indeed, it reaches 80% of the solid-solid drag value for 
\begin_inset Formula $Ca=0.5$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $h^{*}=5$
\end_inset

.
 The ratio does not change between the largest gap investigated and the
 2d-results.
 This indicates that the drag between the plates is already negligible for
 the widest gap 
\begin_inset Formula $h^{*}=5$
\end_inset

.
 For a narrowing gap thickness the ratio 
\begin_inset Formula $d_{f}/d_{s}$
\end_inset

 decreases for all capillary numbers.
 For 
\begin_inset Formula $h^{*}<1/2$
\end_inset

 Either 
\begin_inset Formula $Ca\geq1.25\times10^{-1}$

and the ratio barely change with the gap or 
\begin_inset Formula $Ca<1.25\times10^{-1}$

 and the ratio increases, i.e.
 the fluid-fluid drag increases compared to the solid-fluid drag, for a
 narrowing gap.

\begin_layout Standard
We conduct three-dimensional one-phase flow simulations into a microchannel
 to determine the approximation made on the drag calculation when considering
 that the fluid-fluid contour can be translated along the 
\begin_inset Formula $z$
\end_inset

-direction.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
One side of the microchannel is a half-circle wall to mimic a fluid-fluid
 interface whereas the opposite side is a flat wall (Fig.

\end_inset


\begin_inset CommandInset ref

).
 We obtain the curved side by extruding a cylinder; thus a special treatment
 is done to correctly meshed the very thin part left, and we build very
 small chamfers (Fig.
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset


\begin_inset CommandInset ref

 We compute the drag force per unit surface area on each sidewall of the
 microchannel and plot in Fig.

 the drag force exerted upon the curved side normalized with respect to
 the flat wall.
 The drag per unit surface area exerted upon the curved wall is roughly
 70% of the drag per unit surface area upon the flat wall.
 Giving the greater extent of surface area for the curved wall, the difference
 regarding the drag value is negligible.

Drag force and drag force per unit surface area exerted upon the curved
 wall of the microchannel normalized with respect to the drag force exerted
 upon the flat wall.
 The drag exerted upon the curved solid wall is almost equal to the drag
 exerted upon the flat wall, since the smaller drag per unite surface area
 is almost fully compensated by the greater surface area.

, which relies on a surface discretization of the interface and a pseudo-analyti
cal formulation in the bulk of the phases.
 This allows us to precisely locate the interface, even in the case of very
 thin film flow, and to carefully analyze the choice of parameters in Eq.

 The model is initially fully saturated with fluid

 is injected.
 We test either the 
\begin_inset Formula $\phi=0.5$

 contour is an appropriate definition for the fluid-fluid interface and
 in what extent the value of the initialization parameter 
\begin_inset Formula $\psi$

 we present the half-part of the model and the interface between the fluids
 at time 
\begin_inset Formula $t=2.5$
\end_inset

, for an aspect ratio 
\begin_inset Formula $h/L$
\end_inset

, where 
\begin_inset Formula $L$
\end_inset

 is the width of the fluid 
\begin_inset Formula $o$
\end_inset

 inlet channel.
 We present three different interfaces obtained with the LS method, depending
 on the initialization parameter value.
 This parameter is normalized with respect to the inlet velocity of fluid
 
\begin_inset Formula $o$
\end_inset

, which is three times greater than the fluid 
\begin_inset Formula $w$
\end_inset

 inlet velocity.
 The interface position obtained with the LS method is almost identical
 to that obtained with the BEM, regardless of value of 
\begin_inset Formula $\psi$
\end_inset

.
 However, the best results, especially regarding the interface tip position,
 is obtained for 
\begin_inset Formula $\psi=U_{o}^{\mathrm{inlet}}$
