\begin_layout Abstract
The macroscopic description of two-phase flows in porous media requires
 accurate modelling of the drag forces between the two fluids and the solid
 phase.
 In standard porous media, where capillarity is often dominant, the fluid-solid
 interactions are well-known and the fluid-fluid drag force is treated in
 a similar way as the drag between fluids and solid in the momentum transport
 equation.
 Two-phase flows in highly permeable porous media, however, are often characteri
zed by a larger area of the interface between the two fluids and the development
 of thin films.
 In such cases, the fluid-fluid interaction is not necessarily negligible
 and may play an important role in the momentum transport equations.
 Here, we use computational methods to study two-phase flows in a microfluidic
 device made of an array of cylinders squeezed between two plates in a Hele-Shaw
 flow cell.
 The idea is to keep the geometry in the cell plane unmodified whereas the
 aperture 
\begin_inset Formula $h$
\end_inset

 between the plates is changed to explore different ranges of permeability.
 This is done by solving depth-averaged flow equations, taking advantage
 of the quasi-planar nature of the flow.
 We reproduce a film-flow regime and show that the fluid-fluid drag is non-negli
gible as it reaches between 5% and 60% of the solid-fluid drag.

Our results demonstrate that the fluid-fluid drag force should not be neglected
 in momentum transport equations and behaves differently than the drag upon
 solids, confirming that a no-flow condition between fluids is not suitable.
 This is an important part of the physics that has strong implications relevant
 for upscaling and modelling two-phase flows in microfluidic devices or
 highly permeable porous media.

An accurate description of two-phase flows in high-permeability porous media
 is of major importance in several practical applications.

 However, most of the literature on two-phase flows in porous media is focused
 on low-permeability porous media.
 For low-permeability porous media in the limit of creeping flows, surface
 tension forces often dominate the flow; thus the capillary, Bond, and Weber
 numbers are low.
 In that case, the fluid repartition is well described as two independent
 flow paths for each phase 
\begin_inset ERT

\begin_layout Plain Layout

citep{dullien2012porous,blunt2017multiphase}
\end_layout

\end_inset

.
 The two fluids are segregated, the non-wetting fluid flows into the larger
 pores, whereas the wetting fluid occupies the smaller pores.
 One of the consequences is that the area of the fluid-fluid interface is
 small (Fig.

\end_inset

 (a)) and there is little drag between the fluid phases.
 In contrast, for high-permeability porous media, the flow is the result
 of a complex interaction between capillary, gravity, viscous, and inertial
 forces

\begin_layout Plain Layout

citep{davit2018one}
\end_layout

\end_inset

.
 Capillary effects may no longer dominate and the capillary, Bond, and Weber
 numbers may be large.
 The distribution of fluids in the pore space can be schematically decomposed
 in two modes, even though the reality is often a lot more complex.
 Either the non-wetting fluid is continuous and flows in the center of the
 pores surrounded by the wetting fluid flowing as a thin film in contact
 with the solid (Fig.
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset


\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:fluidPatterns"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

 (b)), or the non-wetting fluid is discontinuous and flows in the center
 of the pores in the form of droplets or ganglias (Fig.
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset


\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:fluidPatterns"

\end_inset

 (c)).
 In both cases, the surface area between the fluids is large and the drag
 forces between the fluids are not negligible compared with the solid-fluids
 drag forces.
 This is in strong contrast with capillarity-dominated flow and it is important
 because, as discussed in the following, modelling of the drag forces is
 the basis of any attempt to establish continuous relationships on a macroscopic
 scale starting from the pore scale.

 This generalization depends on the introduction of relative permeabilities
 that essentially account for the division of the available void space between
 the fluids; thus each fluid phase acts as a supplementary solid regarding
 the other one and no interaction between the phases is taken into account

 Since the early 1980s, numerous works have aimed at improving the generalized
 Darcy equations on a sound physical basis.
 Using upscaling techniques, several authors proposed additional coupling
 terms that correspond to stresses at the fluid-fluid interface and yield
 coupling permeability tensors

 However, results suffer from a major shortcoming.
 Indeed, it is impossible to know which type of flow regime dominates at

 on relative coupling permeabilities.
 Hele-Shaw cells are one of the simplest example of micromodels as they
 consist of two parallel plates in between which the fluids flow.
 Governing equations for the flow in such cells are similar to Darcy's equation,
 and thus the permeability can be easily modified by increasing or decreasing
 the aperture between the plates

 Here, we study the influence of micromodel's absolute permeability on the
 fluid-fluid drag and solid-fluids drag for different capillary numbers.
 The original idea of the article is to solve the appropriate depth-averaged
 equations for two-phase flows in a Hele-Shaw cell to study the effect of
 the varying absolute permeability on the drag forces without having to
 change the in-plane geometry.

 We obtain these results in the fourth unit-cell (UC4) at steady-state.
 The drag terms are not very sensitive to the mesh density and the interface
 between the fluids is correct even for a coarse mesh and converges very
 quickly.

Results and discussion
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Before presenting the results for drag force terms, we briefly discuss the
 two-phase flow regime observed along with the variation of the saturation
 with time.
 The flow regime is fundamental as it drives the extent of the interfacial
 surface area between the fluids.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Paragraph
Two-phase flow regimes
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We observe that the two fluids remain continuous at all times and for the
 entire range of tested capillary numbers and aperture.
 The interface between the fluids becomes stationary and a stationary state
 is reached for every capillary number and aperture values.

 repartition for the case 
\begin_inset Formula $Ca=1\times10^{-1}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $h^{*}=1/8.$
\end_inset

 At steady-state, the fluid-fluid interface is periodic on the five central
 unit cells whereas the interface is slightly deformed at the inlet and
 outlet cells, under the influence of boundary conditions.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We could have expected a break-up of the invading phase either by snap off
 phenomena, or by the shear action of the wetting fluid flow.
 However, the pore throat is large and the fractional flow is low, which
 favours the continuity of the fluid phases.
 The flow regime observed is therefore a film-flow regime within the limit
 of the parameters chosen for this study.
 We obtained all the following results in the fourth unit-cell (UC4) in
 order to be far from the influence of the inlet and outlet boundary conditions.

Saturation
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Wetting fluid saturation at steady-state decreases, in average, from 0.6
 to 0.4 as the aperture between the plates decreases from 5 to 1/20.
 This can be seen in Fig.

\end_inset

, which presents the saturation in UC4 as a function of the dimensionless
 aperture and for different capillary numbers.
 The saturation does not depend on the capillary number for the smallest
 apertures.
 However, as the aperture between the plates increases, the fluid-fluid
 interface becomes flatter and the saturation of the wetting fluid increases
 until it converges to the saturation obtained for the 2D limit case which
 values slightly depend on the capillary number (see saturation fields insets
 in Fig.

 The viscous part is obtained through the velocity gradient available at

 In the following, we are interested in the drag force component in the

-direction, i.e., the main flow direction.
 The drag force exerted upon the solid-fluids boundaries, denoted

 fluids, as defined in Tab

 function of the aperture between the plates and different values of capillary
 number.
 
\change_inserted -1030020954 1593600840
Our results show that the fluid-fluid drag is non-negligible compared to
 the solid-fluid drag.
 At most, the fluid-fluid drag reaches 80% of the value of the solid-fluid
 drag and this occur for high 
\begin_inset Formula $Ca$
\end_inset

 and large aperture.
 The results from the purely 2d simulations (
\begin_inset Formula $h^{*}\rightarrow\infty)$
\end_inset

 indicate that for 
\begin_inset Formula $h/L=5$
\end_inset

, the larger aperture tested, the contribution of the drag upon the plates
 is already insignificant.
 Then, by narrowing the aperture, the fluid-fluid drag decreases compared
 to the solid-fluid drag, until 
\begin_inset Formula $h^{*}=1/2$
\end_inset

.
 From 
\begin_inset Formula $h^{*}=1/2$
\end_inset

 and below the fluid-fluid drag either remains constant, for the higher
 Ca, or increases.
 
\change_unchanged
The ratio decreases as the aperture decreases, until the aperture 
\begin_inset Formula $h^{*}=1/2$
\end_inset

 from which the ratio either remains approximately constant for 
\begin_inset Formula $Ca=5\times10^{-1}$
\end_inset

 or increases for lower capillary numbers.
 The fluid-fluid drag is 40% of the solid-fluid drag, regardless the value
 of 
\begin_inset Formula $Ca$
\end_inset

, for the smallest aperture.

 flows, and we investigated the effect of the permeability on the drag forces
 exerted upon the different phase interfaces.
 The permeability was changed by varying the Darcean term which arising
 from the depth-averaging, thus without altering the in-plane geometry.
 These drag terms have to be modelled to obtain the macroscopic momentum
 transport equations but the drag exerted upon the the fluid-fluid interface
 is commonly neglected for flow driven by capillarity forces.
 Here we focused on film-flow regime pourencountered in two-phases flows
 in high permeability porous media or in microfluidic devices.
 We found that the drag exerted upon the fluid-fluid interface should not
 be neglected into the momentum transport equations for film-flow regimes.
 Lower permeability does not make the drag force terms at the interface
 negligible as long as the flow regime remains a film regime.
 On the contrary, the fluid-fluid drag force increases faster than the drag
 upon the fluid-solid interfaces, as the aperture between the plates decreases.

\begin_layout Standard
We conduct three-dimensional one-phase flow simulations into a microchannel
 to determine the approximation made on the drag calculation when considering
 that the fluid-fluid contour can be translated along the 
\begin_inset Formula $z$
\end_inset

-direction.

\begin_layout Standard
One side of the microchannel is a half-circle wall to mimic a fluid-fluid
 interface whereas the opposite side is a flat wall (Fig.

 We obtain the curved side by extruding a cylinder; thus a special treatment
 is done to correctly meshed the very thin part left, and we build very
 small chamfers (Fig.

 the drag force exerted upon the curved side normalized with respect to
 the flat wall.
 The drag per unit surface area exerted upon the curved wall is roughly
 70% of the drag per unit surface area upon the flat wall.
 Giving the greater extent of surface area for the curved wall, the difference
 regarding the drag value is negligible.

Drag force and drag force per unit surface area exerted upon the curved
 wall of the microchannel normalized with respect to the drag force exerted
 upon the flat wall.
 The drag exerted upon the curved solid wall is almost equal to the drag
 exerted upon the flat wall, since the smaller drag per unite surface area
 is almost fully compensated by the greater surface area.

cal formulation in the bulk of the phases.
 This allows us to precisely locate the interface, even in the case of very
 thin film flow, and to carefully analyze the choice of parameters in Eq.

 The model is initially fully saturated with fluid

 We present three different interfaces obtained with the LS method, depending
 on the initialization parameter value.
 This parameter is normalized with respect to the inlet velocity of fluid
 
\begin_inset Formula $o$
\end_inset

, which is three times greater than the fluid

 One can clearly observe that the interface position obtained with the LS
 method is almost identical to that obtained with the BEM, regardless of
 value of 
\begin_inset Formula $\psi$

 However, the best results, especially regarding the interface tip position,
 is obtained for 
\begin_inset Formula $\psi=U_{o}^{\mathrm{inlet}}$
